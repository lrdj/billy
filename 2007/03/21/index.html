<h2>March 21, 2007</h2>


<h3 id="a013794">'you don't say mair'</h3>

<p>It was nice to see everyone in Scotland even if not the reason you'd choose to get together. Lewis and the 'gerrils' enjoyed each others' company very much and we had a nice trip to Auntie Lorna's and some family resting places. We visited the towns where I lived and went to school until I was around Apoa and Kiloh's ages, which of course was more interesting to them than me, and the Bass at Inverurie where Mary ('born twice, died twice') Elphinstone is buried (supposedly -  we didn't have time to look for her grave).**</p>

<p>Apoa and Kiloh kept laughing at my rapidly reaccommodating language, objecting to my use of words like 'baith' and 'mair' which they insist I don't say. I tried to coach their acccents a bit. The vowel in words like 'Billy' is a bit tough for them and Lewis's pronunciation of the Billy who's his best friend at nursery had the girls thinking his friend was 'Bowie'. We also mused on the different vowels in the 'fit' that means 'pardon' or 'what' and the 'fit' at the end of your leg (same vowel as 'Billy').</p>

<p>It was also good to catch up on some other phrases like 'makkin on' (pretending), and 'getting into trouble'. I don't know whether it's just my rellies but I also noticed some words that would seem too formal for everyday speech (e.g. 'incorporate', 'discretion') in informal conversation.</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p>**The story is that she had been accidentally buried alive and came back to consciousness when grave robbers removed her ring. A quick google suggests that the story has been transplanted to Inverurie from elsewhere but we won't let that get in the way of a good story, will we?</p>
