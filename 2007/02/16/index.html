<h3 id="a013753">would you lecture blog?</h3>

<p>We don't get as many people commenting on <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org">The Lecture List</a> as we'd hoped for and have wondered whether we should have a Lecture List blog (we did have one before the actual site was launched). Maybe it's time to start it up again. I'm sure people have interesting things to talk about. Two experiences I'd have reported involve <a href="http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/chomsky/index.html">Noam Chomsky</a> One was the slightly surreal experience of sitting in a room in Oxford with a crowd of people listening to a large Wharfedale speaker as Chomsky spoke in the lecture theatre next door. The hall was full so we were in the 'overspill room'.  The other was the time at <span class="caps">UCL </span>when there were too many people in the room. Chomsky had been formally, and elegantly, introduced by <a href="http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/neil/">Neil Smith</a> and had got around two sentences out when a security man walked up to him and asked him to stop. There followed  a stand-off as Neil explained that either some of us had to leave or the talk would be cancelled. Interesting though the Tarantinoesque standoff was, I decided I could think of more fun things to do and left. Enough people did leave in the end for the talk to carry on and I read the written up version later.</p>

<h3 id="a013752">The Lecture List</h3>

<p>I'm very chuffed with how <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org">The Lecture List </a>has been getting on. We just had a contact from an organiser who has found that, since he started listing the site with us (as well as a few other places), they have been getting 170 people showing up to their 136-seater lecture theatre. He'd accidentally indicated that the next talk was at his home and was a little bit worried about having that number of people showing up at his place.</p>
