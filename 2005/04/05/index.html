<h2>April  5, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009366">devon</h3>

<p>We had a great Easter time in Devon with Clemmie and her extended family. Clemmie's approaching her third birthday now and her egg-hunting skills have really come on. Her linguistic abilities are also amazing - she's now firmly in the stage which <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140175296/">Steven Pinker</a> describes as 'all hell breaks loose' and never stops speaking. She loved her day out at the fun park -  a context where grownups just say yes to everything you ask to do! Although I think Swinging Queen Bess was one ride too far.</p>

<p>The other kids had a great time too. Highlights for me included the fishermen silhouetted in the moonlight on Easter Saturday, Oisin racing ahead and getting lost on our walk along the cliffs (that's a loose use of 'highlight', you understand) and the Sunday pub visit with a really enjoyable walk there and back. Apoa and Kiloh took 80 photos on the walk to the pub. Thank god for digitisation!</p>

<h3 id="a009365">special providence</h3>

<p>Three posts in a row! Or is it four? Anyway, I'm very much enjoying cycling home in the daylight these days and with less clothing. I've found recently that the only way I can be allowed to spend time vegging on the sofa watching things like <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0390521/">supersize me</a> (last night - great fun, and yes, we did accompany it with some junk food - interesting to see the themes shared with <a href="http://www.channel4.com/life/microsites/J/jamies_school_dinners/">Jamie's School Dinners</a>, the third time that he's provided our most must-see <span class="caps">TV, </span>we realised) with Ohna is if I stay fairly late at work, which has meant it's been dark on the way home rather a lot recently. So it's great that the clocks have changed and now I cycle home through the park in daylight listening to loads of birds. And today i saw a sparrow (a rare sight in London these days).</p>

<h3 id="a009364">computer youth</h3>

<p>We've reached the stage now where, when I sit at my computer working on my homework, either Apoa or Kiloh is sitting next to me working on theirs. Which is cool. At home, I'm in the soppy mac world while they're masters of the PC universe.</p>

<h3 id="a009363">musical youth</h3>

<p>Apoa's new school is in Enfield which means she had her Easter break a week later than everyone else and is still off this week. The Harringay kids had a training day yesterday so they all spent the day composing songs and filming pop promos. They've been working on the music constantly since then. The band they've formed is called 'The Neighbours'.</p>

<p>Some nice linguistic data in this <a title="A Donkey on the Edge" href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/advertising_and_digital_marcomms/april_fool.html">april fool</a> I was pointed to by <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com">dug</a></p>

<p>We managed quite a few on the day itself, as well as one that grandma wasn't going to fall for not no way,</p>
