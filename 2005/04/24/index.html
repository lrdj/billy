<h3 id="a009405">justifying the licence fee</h3>

<p>Can't believe they got to broadcast this story making an analogy between Tony Blair and evil aliens trying to destroy the planet ('aliens have incredible superweapons ... capable of deployment in 45 seconds ... weapons of mass destruction ... UN needs to grant us the power to use nukes... etc.') during the election campaign. I suppose they're counting on how stupid Tony would look if he kicked up a fuss about <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/">Dr. Who</a> ;-)</p>

<p> Great to see Penelope Wilton in it too B-)</p>

<h3 id="a009404">whale's tails and princesses</h3>

<p>Today I should have helped Ohna and Apoa sort out some of the mess in the spare room and I should have helped our local Woodcraft Folk sort out the camping equipment in the store. But I've done my neck in (probably partly to do with the bus trip to Oxford yesterday) so now I'm damaging my neck doing a pile of marking and listening to itunes shuffling around. The joy of 'shuffle' is of course the stuff you forgot you had. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007IFR5/qid=1114357707/">The Cocteau Twins</a> singing Whale's Tails was the highlight so far, but they've just been topped by Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret's 'A Broadcast Message To Children' which they recorded during World War Two and you can hear on the British Library's The Century In Sound. Very spooky to suddenly hear this very posh child's voice from a whole other world.</p>

<p>I recommend the bus as a way of getting to Oxford, btw. A quick cycle down to Baker Street, the bike goes in the boot and you can fall asleep listening to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00070DK5A/qid=1114357756/">David Bowie</a> performing live and doing your neck in until you arrive, wake up and get cycling.</p>

<p>It was really nice to see Robbie and cycle round the pubs of Oxford with him. He needs to find some mates, though, and some artistic inspiration. Any friendly humans in Oxford?</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p>PS Seminar task: spot the syntactic ambiguity in this post ;-)</p>
