<h2>April 11, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009373">shopping and cycling</h3>

<p>Big day of shopping yesterday. I had two things on my list - shoelaces and photos to develop - and, after trailing round Oxford Street and Covent garden all day, I managed to come home having accomplished neither of them. We had a good day, though. The town wasn't too crowded but the kids did get bored of being constantly flattened by people in a hurry. We managed to buy some nice clothes and the birthday presents that were needed, as well as spending some of the girls' christmas credit at <span class="caps">HMV </span>and Claire's Accessories, before going for a lovely meal in Carluccio's on the way home. Got home too late, though, with one girl (Apoa) suffering serious tummyache.</p>

<p>Apoa was surprised yesterday morning by the delivery of her new bike so we arranged to go out cycling with the kids and some of their pals this afternoon. Tragically, though, Apoa hurt her arm landing badly off the trapeze this morning, so she and Jessie walked to the park instead. She had a hard time getting to sleep tonight so I might be going to the doctor's instead of my first year class tomorrow morning. I feel bad about the students but i don't want to repeat my mistake with Kiloh when she broke her arm and it took me 10 days before I thought of taking her to the doctor (I even forced her through a swimming lesson with an arm she couldn't straighten out properly - bad dad!)</p>

<p>B-(</p>

<h3 id="a009372">a new analogy</h3>

<p>The guy in the bike shop offered a new analogy instead of the one about the axe with the changing handle and blade, which was pop groups like The Cure who have had loads of changes of personnel but people constantly remaining fans. I'd have thought The Fall would be a better analogy, since they've had about a million members and even had their line-up change during a gig. I had the incredible experience once of seeing my brother appear as their lead singer at the start of their set at Dingwall's. The linguists I was with thought I was joking when I got excited and told them that was my brother. One of our au pairs was in a band in Sweden who had an open membership policy. Anyone who wanted to be was in the band whether or not they ever actually performed with them.</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p>PS I feel very positively about the shop who fixed my bike, so I think I won't mention to them that they put my tyre on back to front B-}</p>
