<h3 id="a009415">monster raving loony apoa</h3>

<p>Yes, Apoa is representing the Monster Raving Loony Party in her school's mock election (canvassing rather than standing as a candidate). She just watched the whole of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/question_time/default.stm">Question Time Special</a> (no school tomorrow cos of a training day). Kiloh watched a bit of it too, but she does have school tomorrow so she was in bed before the vampire came on. It's interesting to watch the girls begin to get interested in politics and think things through for themselves.</p>

<p>I'm still not sure exactly what I'll do next week. Obviously, Howard and the Tories would be a nightmare, but can I really do the <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/election2005/archives/2005/04/13/hold_your_nose_and_vote_labour.html">nosepeg</a> thing? The bad bits of Labour are so bad I don't think I can do it. On the other hand, I do think they've done some good. But is 'we know we're awful but these guys are worse' really enough to convince me to vote for them? On the other other hand, as Joe E. Brown so famously put it, 'nobody's perfect!' I'm thinking more and more I should just vote for something that doesn't turn my stomach (that would be Green or LibDem) and see what happens. It's interesting that the more Labour try to argue their case the less I want to vote for them.</p>

<p>Kiloh's been reading this blog. She's asked me to check with her from now on whenever I'm going to post about her.</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p>Whoops! Forgot to check about this one!</p>
