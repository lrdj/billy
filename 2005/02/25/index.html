<h2>February 25, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009306">good grief!</h3>

<p>I might have mentioned that I'm writing encyclopedia articles just now as well as editing a section in the encyclopedia. There are just a few articles I'm responsible for that still need a bit of revising, but theoretically I have 6 more to write myself by Monday. Before I left last night I went over one of them changing some things, including stuff I was sure I'd already changed. Sure enough, I just found a version of the paper that already had some of the changes in it. Which means that where I am now is more or less where I had already got to a couple of weeks ago. Grrr! The reassuring thing is that a lot of the changes I made yesterday are more or less the same as the ones I'd made before.</p>

<h3 id="a009305">the shocking truth about tabloids</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.nme.com/news/111519.htm"><span class="caps">NME </span>- Tory attacks Pete Doherty</a></p>

<p>Apparently, Michael Howard said:</p>

<blockquote>'Here you have a man who takes drugs and gets locked up - yet ends up on the front pages'</blockquote>

<p>Does he live in the same country as me?</p>

<h3 id="a009304">language and school</h3>

<p><a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/1419education/story/0,15147,1424030,00.html">The Guardian - Outcry at Kelly's exam reforms</a></p>

<p><a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,9830,1424877,00.html">The Guardian - big fall in language students</a></p>

<p>Neither of these stories is much of a surprise. They made clear they'd be making a retreat from Tomlinson as soon as the report was made public. I'm sure it's as much to do with fear of bad press if they say they're scrapping <span class="caps">GCSE</span>s and A levels as it is to do with what they really think about the proposals.</p>

<p>The language news is a complete disaster. One interesting fact that the report doesn't mention is that language courses offered outside degree programmes are doing quite well. Numbers of students taking a language as part of their degree are falling but a lot of them want to learn a language outside their degree programmes.</p>
