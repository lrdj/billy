<p>Just listening to <a href="http://www.groove.nl/cd/8/81474.html">an electric storm</a> by White Noise, which I'd completely forgotten about until it came 10th in the <a href="http://www.mojo4music.com/">mojo</a> top 50 most out there! albums of all time.</p>

<h3 id="a009278">bling is rinsed out, man</h3>

<p>We discussed this utterance in class today, which, being a neek, I found in <a href="http://society.guardian.co.uk/societyguardian/story/0,,1387795,00.html">this Guardian article</a></p>

<p>Later I suggested we'd said enough about a different example we were looking at and and one of the students said, 'Yeah we rinsed it, man'</p>

<h3 id="a009277">puking and punctures</h3>

<p>Apoa's school phoned yesterday afternoon to say she'd been sick. Since all her mates were staying late and she didn't seem up to going home on her own, the school organised her a taxi. I thought it was a fairly minor thing until I got home and found she'd puked in the playground, gone to the sick room, taken some air, puked again, puked in the taxi home (outside the door as he'd stopped at a light), puked at Andrew and Cathy's house (she had to go there when she got home cos we were out) puked on the doorstep on the way home and then puked a few times after she got home. She's had a quiet day and should be back at school tomorrow, but you know she's not quite right yet when she chooses not to go to pancake night with the <A href="http://woodcraft.org.uk">woodcraft</a> folk.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my bike had its third puncture since Friday today (yes, I've changed the tyres) so I had a bit of a rush to make it to school to talk to Apoa's guitar teacher. The other big musical excitement is that Kiloh brought her double bass home yesterday (quarter size but still sizeable). Haringey offered her free lessons and free hire of instrument for a term since not many people have been opting for it recently.</p>
