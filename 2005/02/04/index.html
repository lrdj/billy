<h2>February  4, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009267">ministry of truth</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.orwelltoday.com/senatehouse.shtml"><img height="250" width="146" alt="senatehouse2.jpg" src="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/billy/senatehouse2.jpg" width="452" height="640" /></a></p>

<p>Spent most of yesterday in <a href="http://www.orwelltoday.com/senatehouse.shtml">Senate House</a>, a beautiful building that was used as the Ministry of Information during World War II and which was the model for George Orwell's Ministry of Truth. Funnily enough, Keith didn't know that when he referred to 'Room 101' during one of our meetings. When I met him earlier he said 'this is Richard the Third'. It took me a while to realise he was referring to the <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0114279/">movie with Ian McKellen</a> set in a fascist 1930's England. Also funnily enough, I'm currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1843543265/qid=1107514130/">Orwell - The Observer Years</a>. He's such a good writer, but it's also fascinating to read his reports about what was happening 'on the ground' in Paris and Germany at the end of the war.</p>

<p>I followed two meetings of academics in Senate House with yet another meeting with Griselda, working on getting a partner/'angel' sorted for <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org">The Lecture List</a>, which is doing great but really needs to find a partner now. (Any offers?)</p>

<p>I then fitted in a quick bit of work in Borders (just managing on the way to pick up a double bass book for Kiloh from a nice man in Denmark Street who was trying to lock up but took the trouble to get me the book before he did) and then I went to meet Ohna who had spent the day waiting for a meeting that still hasn't happened.</p>

<p>We thought we must have good karma when we managed to get the lucky window seat in the Dog and Duck, but this morning began with tax disasters and now my bike has a puncture and a broken rack.</p>

<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>that should keep you going. Back to work.</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p>PS Please, someone, find a home for <a href="http://www.robbiebushe.co.uk">Robbie</a> in Oxford. I can't bear what that bus trip is doing to him.</p>
