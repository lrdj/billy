<h2>February 22, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009298">snow and shaving</h3>

<p>Came home last night to find Kiloh had accidentally shaved off part of her eyebrow. Taking a decent photo is surprisingly hard. When she was four, Apoa gave herself what we described as her 'Tellytubby' haircut. It'd be nice to add the eyebrow to the collection. We're wondering whether Kiloh will get teased today or whether everyone will think it's cool.</p>

<p>We woke the kids up around 10 last night so they could look at the snow. 5 minutes later the doorbell rang and Aidan snowballed Ohna when she answered. 5 minutes after that we heard tapping on glass and assumed he was back with another attack. We shouted at him to get lost and then realised it was Christel who'd locked herself out while taking a picture of the wee menace.</p>

<p>Not much snow on the ground today but they say there'll be more later today. The kids are desperate for more. Apoa is fantasising about missing school and worrying about not being able to get home, but I told her neither of these was likely. She's jealous of those Aberdonians (well Aberdeenshire-onians) who had 30 schools closed yesterday. My worry is if the roads get icy as that's the one thing that would keep me off the bike. The thought of public transport is not appealing.</p>

<p>B-)</p>
