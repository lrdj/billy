<h2>February 16, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009291">Tony's wife loves Cherie's husband</h3>

<p>We looked at this example in class yesterday:</p>

<p><i>His wife loves her husband</i></p>

<p>It's mentioned by Chomsky (Knowledge of Language 1986) and the question is whether it's grammatical if the referent of <i>his</i> is the same as the referent of <i>husband</i> and the referent of <i>wife</i> is the same as the referent of <i>her</i></p>

<p>Naturally, when discussing it you imagine a particular couple and the most likely are the current Prime Minister and his wife/her husband. So we were wondering whether this could mean that <i>'Tony's Cherie loves Cherie's Tony'</i> iyswim. We then tried a number of tests including imagining contexts such as:</p>

<p>A: Nobody could possibly have any affection for Tony Blair!<br />
B: Oh, I don't know. I imagine <i>his wife loves her husband</i></p>

<p>This all felt very weird in a context where Tony has just been addressing the British people using a metaphor where he's the erring husband and the people are the wife who's had enough, as reported <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labour/story/0,9061,1412327,00.html">here</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1414634,00.html">David Aaronovitch's comment</a> on this is worth a read (as are loads of others, actually). You can also get <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labour/story/0,,1412458,00.html">the full text here</a></p>

<h3 id="a009290">more technology</h3>

<p>I don't feel old for being amazed by <a href="http://www.skype.com">skype</a></p>

<p>Oisin and Apoa were also excited when Dug and I had a free phone call via the internet earlier this evening. I guess one day they'll be remembering when they thought of this as a new and exciting concept.</p>

<h3 id="a009289">this charming man</h3>

<p>Sitting up late reviewing encyclopedia entries. Thank you <a href="http://www.nme.com"><span class="caps">NME</span></a> and <a href="http://www.channel4.com">Channel 4</a> for putting on the <a href="http://www.nmeawards.com/"><span class="caps">NME</span> Awards</a> shows to keep me entertained. I love hearing musos chat about each other and particularly enjoyed them talking about The Libertines with Pete Doherty being a member of the panel. He really is a charming bugger, isn't he?</p>

<p>I also still get a buzz from emailing an author in the states and getting an instant response at 2 in the morning. I remember when email was new and this was a truly amazing thing. Yes, that's right, I remember when we used the post, sending my first ever article off to a US journal and having to wait for comments to come back in the mail. On bits of paper!</p>

<p>B-))</p>
