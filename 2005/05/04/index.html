<h3 id="a009418">election blog: too smelly?</h3>

<p>Well, I would have liked to have had the time to pass on lots of thoughts and news about the election, but it looks like this will have to be your lot. I've been wavering like never before on this one. I can see that the Tories would be a disaster so 'hold your nose and vote Labour' seems sensible. On the other hand, the stink really is pretty bad and 'the other guys are worse' isn't much of a sales gimmick. On the other other hand, they have done some good stuff and it would be a shame if that was dumped because of their bad side. On the other other other hand, if that happens, isn't it their fault rather than ours? I mean, who is it who's been going round alienating voters? And isn't it good to send the mesasage that you can't get away with some things? I have to say that there have been more cases than usual of election messages pushing me to do the opposite of what they want me to do. The letter from our local Tory candidate began by saying what a good hard-working MP Barbara Roche is! Which she is, so that's quite a strong argument too. The most persuasive, though, was the talk of Blunkett yesterday, and, even more forceful, the talk by Blunkett (i.e. he's persuading me not to vote Labour by saying I'm a self-indulgent middle class whinger if I don't).</p>

<p>I've had a few interesting political discussions recently, including Roger suggesting that this might be 1970 over again, Ade worrying that it might be 1992, and Robert saying that it's <strong>everybody's </strong> fault if it all goes wrong. As he put it:</p>

<p><q>When we had two million on the streets we should have rioted for peace and brought down the government...</q></p>

<p>Although he did add helpfully add that:</p>

<p><q>That would not have worked either.</q></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Apoa's still quite engaged. Apparently, the Tories are the funniest in her school mock election. She can't decide whether to vote for the funny ones since it doesn't really count or go for who she might vote for in real life. Both Apoa and Kiloh are asking if they can come to see the polling booth with me tomorrow. Hope tennagerdom doesn't apatheticise them,</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<h3 id="a009417">kentish weekend</h3>

<p>Holly and Sara celebrated their 50th birthdays together at the weekend at <a href="http://www.mountephraimgardens.co.uk/">Mount Ephraim</a> in Kent. It was a great party with a ceilidh and a number of musical turns, as well as the hanging out and eating and drinking. The best bit, though, was watching the gangs of kids running around having adventures everywhere. Not sure about the brandishing of the dead eel, though.</p>

<p>It was the first time I'd been to Kent (rather than just going through it), apart from a works outing to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/news/stories/200301/06/dreamland.shtml">Dreamland</a> (which has been under threat for a while but looks like being open again for a bit more at least). Kent was much nicer than I'd expected and more in touch with its traditional agricultural past than a lot of bits of the countryside. We got a lot of info from our <a href="http://www.harper128.freeserve.co.uk/">landlord</a> who is Kentish, a volunteer guide for Faversham, and a pub expert. Naturally, I prepurchased a copy of his book on Kentish pub signs while I was there.</p>

<p>We went by bike, taking the train from Harringay to King's Cross, the Circle Line from King's Cross to Victoria and the train from there to <a href="http://www.faversham.org/home/home.asp">Faversham</a> We were particular popular on the Circle Line ;-) We did some cycling around while we there (this was my third weekend of country cycling in a row), including to <a href="http://www.whitstable.org/">Whitstable</a>, which is very busy but much less full of middle class Londoners than I'd been led to believe (unless they were the ones on the private beach). On Monday, we had a really nice cycle along the Saxon Shore Way. Beautifully quiet but difficult terrain: thick spongy grass with occasional mudholes. We were very impressed with the girls' determination and seriously enjoyed the moment of finding the proper path at the end of it, followed by one of those pub lunches that feels better cos you've earned it.</p>

<p>Incredibly, though, I don't think anybody took any pictures B-(</p>
