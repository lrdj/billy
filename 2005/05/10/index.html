<h2>May 10, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009432">music and adventure</h3>

<p>Went to Apoa's music concert after work today and this is me just getting back from it at 11.30pm. Apoa and Kiloh got a lift home and arrived around 9.30ish.</p>

<p>All I can say is that I really appreciate a head teacher who thinks he's leaving a governors' meeting at 10.30pm and is heading off home, only to be met by a biker who's been waiting to explain that his bike is locked in the pupils' bike shed and that the caretaker hasn't got a key, and who still smilingly sorts everything out and sympathises with me for having had to wait so long. I even more appreciate a deputy head who gets out of bed to answer his answer machine and explain where the key is.</p>

<p>The concert was great, with a mix of styles and abilities. Some of the kids were amazingly good. The crowd's favourite was a violin soloist who performed a very complicated piece with no music and then had to return for a second bow. I particularly enjoyed Jessie's trombone version of 'Summertime' which hypnotised the whole room. I thought we were about to be sucked into the end of the trombone. There were also two memorable versions of the Titanic theme, one haunting voice (three vocalists) and piano version in the first half and later a completely different take in which Apoa and some classmates had worked out their own arrangement for two pianists, a bass guitar, flute, clarinet and oboe.</p>

<p>Deadline day is Monday which means I'm being swamped with last-minute drafts, so I spent my waiting time reading about things like case theory and the dative alternation.</p>

<p>Apoa's tube pass ran out today so I had the added pleasure of a visit to the tube station to renew it on the way home, and a cycle down the <span class="caps">A10 </span>on the way - not recommended around 11pm, I'd say.</p>

<p>B-)</p>
