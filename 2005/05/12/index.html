<h3 id="a009435">what the bleep do we know?</h3>

<p>I realise that this publicises the movie, but I can't stop myself from sharing this bit of <a href="http://www.simonsingh.net">Simon</a> Singh's latest newsletter. He's also known for not being Derren Brown's number one fan, btw.</p>

<p>B-)</p>


<p><q>I don't think I have previously used this newsletter to criticise anybody else's work, but when it comes to the utter junk that is 'What the Bleep Do We Know!?' then I am prepared to make an exception.</q></p>

<p><q>I first came across this film when I was in America back in February and now it is about to open in cinemas in the UK and elsewhere. It is the third highest grossing documentary ever and it claims to be about quantum physics, but in fact it makes gross distortions that would make any self-respecting scientist squirm. For example, the film states that experiments imply that labelling a bottle of water with words like 'love' or 'hate' can change its molecular structure. Indeed, the film suggests that quantum physics can explain why this is the case. Apparently quantum physics can also be exploited to bring about world peace through meditation.</q></p>

<p><q>If you have a science background then please do not go and see this film as you will be violently ill afterwards. And if you do not have a science background then please do not go and see this film as you will be submitting yourself to two hours of (badly filmed) pseudoscientific propaganda. If you want to learn about quantum physics then I would advise you to pay a visit to the library or find a TV documentary on the subject - both options cost less and deliver more than this atrocious film.</q></p>

<p><q>As you can tell by now, I really do hate this film. Having spent the last fifteen years making documentaries and writing about science, I care hugely about the accurate and honest portrayal of science. I am working on an article that details exactly why I hate this film so much, and I will put it online soon and link to it in my next newsletter.</q></p>
