<h2>January 22, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009246">Saturday</h3>

<p>Don't tell the publishers, or the students, or the university, but I took time off from academia today (I know I shouldn't feel guilty about that on a Saturday, but there you go). Followed a nice game of football with a wee game of basketball. Martha takes it really seriously. I think that kind of competitiveness is at its height when you're around 10. I think I was around 10 when I started changing channels to check whether Aberdeen had really lost most Saturday teatimes. I remember one time the <span class="caps">BBC </span>said they'd won 5-0 at Ayr and I changed to <span class="caps">ITV </span>who said they'd lost 5-0. It turned out <span class="caps">ITV </span>had got it wrong. B-)</p>

<p>Followed the sport with a bit of computer play (partial success with using Airport to play stuff off the computers through the hifi system, but a bit of a worry that some of my itunes music seems to have disappeared when Dug fixed the computer) and some house organising. Had to borrow a drill cos I still can't find ours, but it looks like we're getting slightly more organised. Ohna did some major work with the help of Muji.</p>

<p>Just listening to some very groovy oldstyle funk on <a href="http://www.radiomagnetic.com">Radio Magnetic</a> which is perfect for a Saturday night when you're getting ready to go out.</p>

<p>Went to a super gig on <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com">Dug</a>'s birthday on Thursday. Ian Broudie in a tiny room upstairs at the Enterprise. Reminded of when Gentleman Jim played my back living room for my fortieth. Particularly enjoyed the double bass - Kiloh is currently taking advantage of free double bass lessons from the Haringey Music Centre.</p>

<p>B-)</p>
