<h3 id="a009256">grammar and writing</h3>

<p>Had a meeting yesterday with a group who are working on knowledge about language at school. We discussed, among other things, the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1396040,00.html">Philip Pullman piece</a> in which he says how mad it would be to think that grammar teaching would help people with their writing. It's a funny debate (if it really is a debate) as the different positions keep getting confused. Some of our group thought Pullman's piece was terrible, but others could see some interesting points in it. I think that my view is that some of the negative bits are attacking a view that doesn't exist (e.g. he implies that people who think grammar teaching is a good idea wouldn't realise that playing with language is a good idea) but some of the positive points make sense (even though I think they're shared by the people he's attacking). He does also say near the end of the piece that 'the study of grammar is intensely fascinating'. So I kind of think a lot of the groups who think they're disagreeing would in fact agree rather a lot if they got round a table. At the same time, though, discussions about 'grammar' are usually quite charged with a lot of baggage to do with personal histories and experiences, class, and so on. It's all quite complicated, but also fascinating. I don't really believe, btw, that it has been shown that studying grammar doesn't, or can't help improve writing. I do agree, though, that writing (with feedback) is one of the best ways to improve your writing. Reading is another. All of this is also relevant to me as I get more and more convinced that the main thing to focus on with students at Middlesex is helping them with their writing. Once you've got a good grasp of what you need to do to write a good academic essay, so much of the rest of it seems to just fall into place.</p>

<p>Hope that all makes sense. Got a bit carried away. (And ignored lots of what I've taught and been taught about how to write - or is that allowed in the blog genre?)</p>

<h3 id="a009252">vera drake - the other view</h3>

<p>Think I just shot down in Justin's estimation. He couldn't have had a more definitively opposite view of the 'appaling...typical Mike Leigh...' load of rubbish I went to see last night. In his mind, it's a cartoony class-divisive black-and-white-morality load of rubbish where the world is divided into lovely lovely working folk and the big bad evil establishment/middle/upper class ones. Oh well.</p>

<h3 id="a009248">vera drake</h3>

<p>Went to see it tonight. Came out of the cinema feeling awestruck and physically affected by it all. I know some people will be critical of what they will see as sentimental aspects (the music, Vera's way of talking) but a) they're wrong, and b) they're wrong. I'm surprised people have seen it as so definitely 'taking sides'. It seems to me that there's a real honesty about the complexity of being a human in all of the characters. Ohna pointed out that, while Vera is 'helping out' the women she treats, she doesn't really connect with them any more than with the guy she keeps making a 'nice cup of tea' for. She comes in, boils the water, does the job, and moves on. And you feel the humanity in the characters who have to do the bad stuff to Vera as much as in the people doing 'good' things. Even the snobby one has some humanity and ability to compromise. The only one you don't have much sympathy for is the black market friend. Except that she is female and it is largely about a deeply sexist society. It reminded me of Zola doing his experiments to observe what happens to characters in particular social situations.</p>

<p>But the most amazing thing was just to see film-makers managing to get every single detail of every image and action so absolutely right. Why bother going to see films with actors in them when you can have films with actual people in them? I haven't seen Million Dollar Baby or The Aviator but I find it deeply weird that they could even be being considered for an oscar in the year that this film came out (except that that kind of weirdness is completely predictable in Oscarland, of course).</p>

<p>Note for pragmatics class: best moment was the Christmas chocolate box. (Note to myself: must also remember 'minced meat' and 'good morning, Mrs. Hooper' from Desperate Housewives). You can see I'm about to switch back into teaching mode now that (most of) the assessment boards are out of the way.</p>
