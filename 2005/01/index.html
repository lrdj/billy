            <p>A long entry this, but I'm not sure I can point you to it somewehere else and it seems both interesting and relevant to Apoa's question about communism and capitalism.</p>

<p>B-)</p>


<blockquote>The Wrap: A worm's eye view

<p>31 January 2005</p>

<p>Is Atlanticism dead? Andrew Brown argues it will soon join communism on the scrapheap of discredited doctrines</p>

<p>History is full of honest mistakes. Sometimes they change character and become mistakes that no honest person could make. Communism is an example.</p>

<p>The list of really admirable ex-communists is long. Among my personal heroes, Denis Healey, Robert Conquest, Arthur Koestler, and Claud Cockburn had all been active party members. All of them joined the party in the 30s, when, in Britain at least, it was still an honest mistake to do so. I don't see how anyone living under Stalin could have been an honest communist then, but this is because I am blinded by hindsight. Solzhenitsyn, for example, was a fervent believer in his youth.</p>

<p>But by 1945, or 1947 at the latest, you couldn't call communism an honest mistake. Anyone who wanted to stay a communist had to ignore so much evidence about the workings of the Soviet Union that they were in a condition of constant bad faith.</p>

<p>There are no doubt plenty of Guardian readers who would argue that this was not the fault of communism, that it has never been really tried, and that without Stalin, or Russia, or Lenin, or the cold war, or some other excuse, things might have been different. There was a wonderful phrase expressing this in the last days of the Soviet empire, when apologists would take about 'actually existing Socialism' by contrast to the communism which didn't actually exist, but which they would prefer to talk about.</p>

<p>But in the end virtually everyone realised that the actually existing things were the only ones worth bothering with and that the ideals of communism were inevitably opposed to its practice. I still remember and admire the courage and seriousness of some of the hunger strikers I met in a church in East Berlin just before the wall came down. They were not risking beatings and worse for capitalism, but for a more just and purified version of something they would have called socialism.</p>

<p>But we can see now that their hope was doomed. There was no halfway house. Political ideals without a country are twittering shades.</p>

<p>Has the same moment of truth has now struck the conservative, or Atlanticist, movement? Like communism, this is not just a political philosophy, but one that has been incarnated in a particular country. British Conservatism of this sort is not just a theory about which institutions best promote human wellbeing, and about the way that change should be managed. It also supposed that these were incarnated in a particular country and its satellites.</p>

<p>This might very well have been true. I'd have accepted it myself as true without any question five years ago. It seemed to me axiomatic. I had never heard of Alberto Gonzalez, nor dreamed of a Britain where the home secretary could denounce the Bar Council as dangerous liberals.</p>

<p>But as we enter the second Bush term, it becomes harder and harder to see Atlanticism as an honest mistake. The language of liberty, of parliamentary government, and of the rule of the law which had seemed, so to say, incarnated in Anglo-Saxon practice now seem entirely meaningless when used by the Blair and Bush administrations. There has to be a moment when the betrayal of these ideals is so absolute that we doubt they can be properly incarnated in the countries where they had seemed rooted.</p>

<p>It's like a divorce. This is particularly difficult for Conservatives, who suppose that such an incarnation takes time, and grows naturally out of the small-scale values and practices of society. Constitutions and elections are not enough. They have to be animated by the right sort of pride. Senator Joe McCarthy was finished when he was asked "Have you no shame?"</p>

<p>It's hard to believe the question could wound our present leaders. To hear Bush praising liberty is like hearing Lenin praise fairness. Obviously this comparison is a little unfair to both men: Bush has not had his secret police shoot tens of thousands of people, and Lenin made his way in the world without help from his father's friends. But there is one very important quality that their rhetoric shares. The words mean nothing, and in both cases this meaninglessness is what carries the real meaning - which is that the powerful can lie to us with complete impunity.</p>

<p>Conservatives shouldn't be shocked by this. Suspicion of the powerful and a distrust of unfettered government were the mainsprings of Conservatism. But they are rendered defenceless when the upholders of law despise it.</p>

<p>The result, in Britain, has been a sort of madness among the conservative intellectuals. They excoriate Blair for Bush's faults, and they have reacted to the Labour government's proposals to introduce house arrest and internment without trial by blaming the European convention on human rights. It is not a European government that is pressing us to destroy the liberty we should be fighting for.</p>

            <p>Apoa just came in and objected that I hadn't explained to her what capitalism is. So we just had a quick seminar. The result is that she says she doesn't know what she thinks but at the moment she's definitely more like a communist than a capitalist.</p>

            <p>Don't tell bozo but I think the missing music on my itunes is only missing cos I downloaded it onto a different computer ;-)</p>

<p>Listening to Candyskin by the <a href="http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=fire_engines">Fire Engines</a> just now (thanks, Robbie). Takes you back. This was <span class="caps">THE </span>song for a wee while back in the day. I seem to be sinking in nostalgia at the moment, having been to see the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A1046738">Gang of Four</a> last night. They were great and not really in a nostalgic way. Ended up going on my own as each of my 'dates' fell by the wayside one after another. Felt like a comedy character being there on my own with two big heavy bike bags, one of which had a computer in it, struggling to the bar with no hands free for my pint. I had remembered the Gang of Four as a bit funky and a bit rock-y but I hadn't thought of the rock bit as being as heavy as it was. They were quite industrial and brutal and didn't really sound like they were from the old days. I was delighted while I was there to be slipped a 'Capitalism? No thanks!' free-access card ('can be used to abolish global credit and debit systems') from <a href="http://www.worldsocialism.org">http://www.worldsocialism.org</a></p>

<p>Followed that with a listen to <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,13887,1240051,00.html">metal box</a> this morning. Mike gave me his spare copy last night. Hadn't listened for ages but it sounded great and Albatross is perfect Saturday morning breakfast music. Twenty odd years ago, we used to listen to Theme from the <a href="http://www.fodderstompf.com/DISCOGRAPHY/LP/3firstLP.html">first pil album</a> when we felt disgustedly hungover with ourselves.</p>

<p>At breakfast I showed the kids the worldsocialism card which meant I had to explain to them what capitalism is.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I think I've got a busy enough weekend without not being able to find my old handouts so that I have to redo the handout for Monday's first year class from scratch.</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Had a meeting yesterday with a group who are working on knowledge about language at school. We discussed, among other things, the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1396040,00.html">Philip Pullman piece</a> in which he says how mad it would be to think that grammar teaching would help people with their writing. It's a funny debate (if it really is a debate) as the different positions keep getting confused. Some of our group thought Pullman's piece was terrible, but others could see some interesting points in it. I think that my view is that some of the negative bits are attacking a view that doesn't exist (e.g. he implies that people who think grammar teaching is a good idea wouldn't realise that playing with language is a good idea) but some of the positive points make sense (even though I think they're shared by the people he's attacking). He does also say near the end of the piece that 'the study of grammar is intensely fascinating'. So I kind of think a lot of the groups who think they're disagreeing would in fact agree rather a lot if they got round a table. At the same time, though, discussions about 'grammar' are usually quite charged with a lot of baggage to do with personal histories and experiences, class, and so on. It's all quite complicated, but also fascinating. I don't really believe, btw, that it has been shown that studying grammar doesn't, or can't help improve writing. I do agree, though, that writing (with feedback) is one of the best ways to improve your writing. Reading is another. All of this is also relevant to me as I get more and more convinced that the main thing to focus on with students at Middlesex is helping them with their writing. Once you've got a good grasp of what you need to do to write a good academic essay, so much of the rest of it seems to just fall into place.</p>

<p>Hope that all makes sense. Got a bit carried away. (And ignored lots of what I've taught and been taught about how to write - or is that allowed in the blog genre?)</p>

            <p>Think I just shot down in Justin's estimation. He couldn't have had a more definitively opposite view of the 'appaling...typical Mike Leigh...' load of rubbish I went to see last night. In his mind, it's a cartoony class-divisive black-and-white-morality load of rubbish where the world is divided into lovely lovely working folk and the big bad evil establishment/middle/upper class ones. Oh well.</p>

            <p>Went to see it tonight. Came out of the cinema feeling awestruck and physically affected by it all. I know some people will be critical of what they will see as sentimental aspects (the music, Vera's way of talking) but a) they're wrong, and b) they're wrong. I'm surprised people have seen it as so definitely 'taking sides'. It seems to me that there's a real honesty about the complexity of being a human in all of the characters. Ohna pointed out that, while Vera is 'helping out' the women she treats, she doesn't really connect with them any more than with the guy she keeps making a 'nice cup of tea' for. She comes in, boils the water, does the job, and moves on. And you feel the humanity in the characters who have to do the bad stuff to Vera as much as in the people doing 'good' things. Even the snobby one has some humanity and ability to compromise. The only one you don't have much sympathy for is the black market friend. Except that she is female and it is largely about a deeply sexist society. It reminded me of Zola doing his experiments to observe what happens to characters in particular social situations.</p>

<p>But the most amazing thing was just to see film-makers managing to get every single detail of every image and action so absolutely right. Why bother going to see films with actors in them when you can have films with actual people in them? I haven't seen Million Dollar Baby or The Aviator but I find it deeply weird that they could even be being considered for an oscar in the year that this film came out (except that that kind of weirdness is completely predictable in Oscarland, of course).</p>

<p>Note for pragmatics class: best moment was the Christmas chocolate box. (Note to myself: must also remember 'minced meat' and 'good morning, Mrs. Hooper' from Desperate Housewives). You can see I'm about to switch back into teaching mode now that (most of) the assessment boards are out of the way.</p>

            <p>Don't tell the publishers, or the students, or the university, but I took time off from academia today (I know I shouldn't feel guilty about that on a Saturday, but there you go). Followed a nice game of football with a wee game of basketball. Martha takes it really seriously. I think that kind of competitiveness is at its height when you're around 10. I think I was around 10 when I started changing channels to check whether Aberdeen had really lost most Saturday teatimes. I remember one time the <span class="caps">BBC </span>said they'd won 5-0 at Ayr and I changed to <span class="caps">ITV </span>who said they'd lost 5-0. It turned out <span class="caps">ITV </span>had got it wrong. B-)</p>

<p>Followed the sport with a bit of computer play (partial success with using Airport to play stuff off the computers through the hifi system, but a bit of a worry that some of my itunes music seems to have disappeared when Dug fixed the computer) and some house organising. Had to borrow a drill cos I still can't find ours, but it looks like we're getting slightly more organised. Ohna did some major work with the help of Muji.</p>

<p>Just listening to some very groovy oldstyle funk on <a href="http://www.radiomagnetic.com">Radio Magnetic</a> which is perfect for a Saturday night when you're getting ready to go out.</p>

<p>Went to a super gig on <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com">Dug</a>'s birthday on Thursday. Ian Broudie in a tiny room upstairs at the Enterprise. Reminded of when Gentleman Jim played my back living room for my fortieth. Particularly enjoyed the double bass - Kiloh is currently taking advantage of free double bass lessons from the Haringey Music Centre.</p>

            <p>Dug spent a good few hours today getting my computer back to life. Now I'm cracking on with marking again. Meanwhile, an author who's working on the encyclopedia emailed to say that his computer crashed on him a couple of days ago. He's based in Jakarta and has been travelling in Sumatra where the tsunami hit. Which kind of puts the panic over a linguistics encyclopedia entry into perspective. He was pleased to hear that I was in a similar situation. He then freaked himself out by making this comment:</p>

<p>'But if you hear a news flash of a meteorite smashing into Jakarta, you'll know<br />
it's my encyclopaedia jinx again.'</p>

<p>and then waking up in the morning to find that there had been an earthquake in Jakarta that night (too small to notice, luckily). Hero that he is, he's now typed up the article that he had a hard copy of and also completely rewritten the one that was totally lost. Wish I was working that quickly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, one of Apoa's friends just came round with her parents to apologise for telling stories that weren't true about relatives being missing in the tsunami. Apparently, during World War <span class="caps">II, </span>they did have a relative who was missing for a week after Sri Lanka was bombed and then turned up safe and sound.</p>

            <p>I guess the stereotypical academic has a lot of marking to do between semesters. And is simultaneously trying to squeeze in various things - writing, editing and so on - that got squeezed out during the semester. I guess if your computer melts down making all of the writing work you've been doing inaccessible just when you're trying to get at least some of your writing off before the 'no no this time we really mean it, it really is the really really final final deadline' so that you can then stay up half the night marking but instead you spend a few hours trying to fix your computer but of course you're not a neek so you've got no idea what you're doing and it's probably a big job anyway, so eventually you give up and you  might as well have given up earlier and just gone on to the marking even if the publishers are really going to be going crazy when the stuff you promised doesn't arrive, then it just makes you even more of a stereotype, right?</p>

<p>Topic shift: the new issue of <a href="http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/lore/index.htm">Lore</a> just came out with a little piece from me on being an <a href="http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/lore/digressions/index.htm">academic who blogs</a> Don't suppose this could count for the <span class="caps">RAE, </span>could it?</p>

            <p>Hope you're enjoying Berlin. I enjoyed the night out last week and taking part in the Laurel and Hardy sketch on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Sorry you've been getting bored checking in to the same old 'poguetry' post for the past month (and for the rainy Hoxton blockage a while back).</p>

<p>See you when you get back,</p>
