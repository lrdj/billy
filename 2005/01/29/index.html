<h3 id="a009258">i'm a liar</h3>

<p>Apoa just came in and objected that I hadn't explained to her what capitalism is. So we just had a quick seminar. The result is that she says she doesn't know what she thinks but at the moment she's definitely more like a communist than a capitalist.</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<h3 id="a009257">music and handouts</h3>

<p>Don't tell bozo but I think the missing music on my itunes is only missing cos I downloaded it onto a different computer ;-)</p>

<p>Listening to Candyskin by the <a href="http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=fire_engines">Fire Engines</a> just now (thanks, Robbie). Takes you back. This was <span class="caps">THE </span>song for a wee while back in the day. I seem to be sinking in nostalgia at the moment, having been to see the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A1046738">Gang of Four</a> last night. They were great and not really in a nostalgic way. Ended up going on my own as each of my 'dates' fell by the wayside one after another. Felt like a comedy character being there on my own with two big heavy bike bags, one of which had a computer in it, struggling to the bar with no hands free for my pint. I had remembered the Gang of Four as a bit funky and a bit rock-y but I hadn't thought of the rock bit as being as heavy as it was. They were quite industrial and brutal and didn't really sound like they were from the old days. I was delighted while I was there to be slipped a 'Capitalism? No thanks!' free-access card ('can be used to abolish global credit and debit systems') from <a href="http://www.worldsocialism.org">http://www.worldsocialism.org</a></p>

<p>Followed that with a listen to <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,13887,1240051,00.html">metal box</a> this morning. Mike gave me his spare copy last night. Hadn't listened for ages but it sounded great and Albatross is perfect Saturday morning breakfast music. Twenty odd years ago, we used to listen to Theme from the <a href="http://www.fodderstompf.com/DISCOGRAPHY/LP/3firstLP.html">first pil album</a> when we felt disgustedly hungover with ourselves.</p>

<p>At breakfast I showed the kids the worldsocialism card which meant I had to explain to them what capitalism is.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I think I've got a busy enough weekend without not being able to find my old handouts so that I have to redo the handout for Monday's first year class from scratch.</p>

<p>B-}</p>
