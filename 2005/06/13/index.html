<h2>June 13, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009455">illness predicted 22.6.05</h3>

<p>Academics often get ill on the first day after term ends. The theory is that you keep yourself at full throttle as long as term's on and then something subconscious allows the illness to kick in as soon as you don't have a class/meeting/deadline for tomorrow. Some academics think it's a good idea to catch a cold a week or two before the end of term just to avoid being in bed for the first week of the break.</p>

<p>Another generalisation about academia is that workloads shoot up at the end of summer teaching as marking coincides with all those meetings that couldn't be scheduled in teaching time and with all those deadlines that got pushed back during the term. This year it's been madder than ever for me, which you'll already know if you've noticed the gap on the blog.</p>

<p>For several weeks now, I've had 22nd June pencilled in as the day when things will get a bit more manageable. So we'll see whether illness awaits (and yes, I do already have two meetings booked in for that day).</p>

<p>Anyway, I think I'm going to sneak the odd minute for a bit of blogging again now. This one is being posted between phone calls on a day of interviewing for a position that attracted such an international set of applicants that we're only seeing two of them in person.</p>

<p>B-)</p>
