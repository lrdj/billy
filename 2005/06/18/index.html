<h3 id="a009466">'randomers'</h3>

<p>I know some of you are interested in language developments in London. Around a year ago, I noticed Apoa using the word <em>random</em> more often than I would have expected, and then noticed lots of kids were doing the same. They weren't using it in a new way, just more often than you would expect. Typical utterances might be:</p>

<blockquote>It was just a random thing to do.</blockquote>
or

<blockquote>There were just a few random people there.</blockquote>

<p>So I was pleased to hear an actual innovation from Charlotte Church on Jonathan Ross last week. She'd been talking about her adventures in 'Chip Alley' (an environ I myself frequented on Cup Final day) and other bits of Cardiff and told him about one time when she was having a meal in a restaurant. She said,</p>

<blockquote>I was sitting there with a few randomers-</blockquote>

<p>Jonathan said,</p>

<blockquote>Hold on a minute. What did you say? 'Randomers'?</blockquote>

<p>And she said,</p>

<blockquote>Yeh, you know, just a few random people.</blockquote>

<p>One interesting thing about it is there isn't any obvius motivation for using this word more frequently. It just seems to have been picked on at random.</p>
