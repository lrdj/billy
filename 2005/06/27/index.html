<h2>June 27, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009474">balloon race</h3>

<p>Apoa came back from Wales on Friday evening. She had a great time and it turned out that she had tried to phone once to leave me a happy father's day message, even though we didn't hear a peep from her all week.</p>

<p>Ohna came back from Cannes yesterday, tired and glad to be back. Cannes was a mixed experience, it seems. The bit that sounded best to me was the groovy parties with Jarvis Cocker DJing and the <a href="http://www.nouvellesvagues.com/">Nouvelle Vague</a> people playing. The bit that sounded worst was the unbelievably rude restaurant.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's great to have the whole family back. We celebrated yesterday by going to Apoa's school's summer fair and having one of those days where no matter how many buses you get on you never seem to get any nearer home. The highlight of the day was when we were all sitting eating tapas and saw a balloon floating down the street with a note attached. The kids rushed out and grabbed it. It seems there was a summer fair with a balloon race in Beaconsfield yesterday. You might not be impressed by that but I've sent off many balloons in my time and never had one found nor known anyone who found one. And we got to play with the helium when we got home.</p>
