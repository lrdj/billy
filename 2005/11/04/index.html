<h3 id="a011990">out of joint</h3>

<p>Now I'm really getting confused. I'm getting emails inviting me to events that happened a couple of days ago and I'm having phone calls where me and the other speaker seem to be in different zones and reference points. This time travel is trickier than I thought.</p>

<p>Last year, one of the classes at Kiloh's school were looking at environmental issues and became interested in what happens to batteries when we throw them away. They were horrified when they found out what happens after you throw a battery in the bin. I went in to class with another grownup to talk about it with them. The kids set up a box at school where everyone could bring their batteries and another grownup has been driving to Barnet where they have a proper battery disposal scheme to get rid of them. The kids also wrote letters to various people including the council about it. Last week, they were awarded a <a href="http://www.haringey.gov.uk/council/strategiesandpolicies/better_haringey/better_haringey_awards_2005.htm">Better Haringey</a> award for 'Best environmental innovation'. The next step is to write to the council again and point out that it would be odd if they didn't introduce a scheme to dispose of batteries properly after they've given this award for this reason.</p>

<p>The server is back and the emails we've missed from the past week are slowly coming through. The timelag is a bit weird. The library has just warned me that some books will become overdue if I don't return them by yesterday and Jon Snow emailed to say that Downing Street says Blunkett won't resign but that I shouldn't faint if he does. On that topic, I have to say that I find it impressive that Blair and Blunkett can keep straight faces when they offer their comments on his resignation, and surprising that journalists let them finish their utterances without falling about laughing. Is there any other walk of life where you respond like this when you mess up?</p>

<p>Slightly relatedly... Despite being a bit of a gooner, I'm being tempted at the moment to look at Arsene Wenger's latest comments in class. In the context of questions about Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, he said 'When you give success to stupid people, it makes them more stupid sometimes and not more intelligent'. He is now angry that journalists suggested he implied Mourinho was stupid. Doing! (Picked this expression up from students yesterday, so not sure whether I'm using it properly, but it is a beautiful word).</p>

<p>Unrelatedly... <a href="http://maizaki.blogspot.com/">Mai</a> just dropped by with some delicious-looking sweet food which I'm going to try when I have a coffee with her later on. I feel a bit guilty as these are traditional things to eat for eid and I haven't spent the last month fasting to prepare for them.</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p>PS Just received another email from Jon Snow. The pressure is increasing on Blunkett, it seems. I'm betting he'll resign before the end of the week...</p>
