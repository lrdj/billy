<h3 id="a012215">two films and an apocalypse</h3>

<p>I would've sent this post at the weekend but you know.</p>

<p>We went to see the original King Kong at the <span class="caps">NFT </span>on Saturday afternoon. I had forgotten that it was the best film ever made. Kiloh gave me a hard time for saying so (this was an allusion to Mark Kermode - I'll tell you later). We then watched Four Weddings and a Funeral when we got home. I'm a big Mike Newell fan so I was delighted that the kids had insisted we rent it. Big excitement when we got to the scene at the <span class="caps">NFT </span>and then on the river at the South Bank. I've got a theory that the most obvious skills of Mike Newell as a director and of Hugh Grant as an actor are the same thing really, being all about timing, which is about judging what your audience needs to have happen when. Also one of the main things you need to get right in teaching.</p>

<p>Clemmie came out with us on Sunday, but the poor wee thing was suffering from a bit of a cold. Nicki came and rescued her at the end of the day.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what to make of the symbolism as I went out on Sunday to buy our Christmas tree under the almighty black cloud that was spreading over us from Hemel Hempstead.</p>

<h3 id="a012214">'randy as a drug-crazed goat'</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/15minutemusical/pip/3s2ha/">bbc - 15 minute musical</a></p>

<p>You can't miss this tragic tale recited by the simple peasant dog Labradore (available on listen again until Tuesday).</p>

<p>An early theme of this blog was the dodginess of some of the things David Blunkett was saying. Who knew how the tale was destined to unfold?</p>
