<h3 id="a012250">kong takes more victims</h3>

<p>We went to see the new King Kong on Kiloh's birthday. Kiloh was the only kid who agreed with me that it wasn't as good as the 1933 movie, but even she thought I was nuts when I said that I preferred the 1933 special effects. I just think that you know where you are when you're looking at 18-inches of metal covered in rabbit skin and you never get those queasy feelings that you do when cgi goes a bit wonky. The main reason the 1933 version is better is because it's perfectly formed, compact storytelling and perefectly paced. There were very few moments in the new one that I didn't enjoy experiencing (although I've never been much into fight scenes and tend to fall asleep until they're over) but it could never have the effect on you that the original did (I've been comparing notes and have found quite a few people who had a similar experience to the 10-year-old me who was up all night talking about it with my brother after my first viewing). Anyway, last night we babysat Clem so that Dug and Nicki could go to see it. They came home early as they couldn't take any more and walked out before the return to New York. Their opinion of the cgi was extremely negative, so maybe I can still convince Kiloh of the superiority of metal and rabbitskin.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Santa brought the kids a <span class="caps">PS2 </span>with a King Kong game. I've been struggling with my spatial ineptitude on Skull Island. You know you're in trouble when you're helpfully advised to 'look behind you!' and you're not quite sure how to do it.</p>
