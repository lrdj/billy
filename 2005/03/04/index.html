<h3 id="a009320">happy birthday apoa</h3>

<p>Apoa woke up at 3.30 and at 3.45 but then managed to sleep until 6. She enjoyed opening cards and pressies in our bed and then had a nice breakfast (brownie and milk - putting aside her anti-exczema dairy freeness for one day) but is particularly pleased that it's snowing properly on her birthday.</p>

<p>We finally gave in and bought her a mobile phone. We used to say she could get one when she could afford to buy one and pay for her own calls, but a train plus bus journey every day persuaded us it would be practical if she had one. We made sure the phone came with everything to get started but of course it came without a battery, so I'm off to Woolies this afternoon.</p>

<p>My bike has been in Crouch End for a couple of days now, following the double puncture on Wednesday (that's 6 in the past month) and I don't like cycling when there are icy roads, so I took the bus which was pleasant. Particularly enjoyed being reminded how ahead of their time Cabaret Voltaire were from the <a href="http://www.mojo4music.com/">Mojo</a> Beyond Punk compiliation, and everyone on the bus enjoyed the bus behind driving into us (slowly) at a bus stop on the way.</p>

<h3 id="a009319">greedy mothers</h3>

<p>Just received this warning from a cyclists' email group:</p>

<blockquote>Beware Mothers' Day

<p>Sue has asked me to remind all Little Green Riders that the pubs will be full of mothers this Sunday. That means that it might be an idea to come armed with more food than you think you can eat.....just in case.</p>

See y'all soon.</blockquote>
