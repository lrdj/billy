<h2>March 23, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009335">producers, blackberries and holding your drink</h3>

<p>It's been a busy week. Went to see The Producers with Ohna on Monday. It's not perfect, but I think you have to see it. Brad Oscar is great as Max so we didn't miss Nathan Lane. Interesting that I found the comedy gays a bit boring even though the show is nothing but tasteless jokes, with comedy nazis and comedy old ladies etc. Ohna's been given a blackberry by her work which I would think of as a disaster. Sure enough, she was being emailed in and out of the theatre. We went for a bite afterwards and she was outside on the phone when our food arrived.</p>

<p>Went to an opening with Dug and Alan last night and then Ohna joined us later. Found myself not coping too well with the alcoholic intake, so I'll try to be sensible tonight.</p>

<h3 id="a009334">if you can't lobby, go to the alley</h3>

<p>I thought I was going to lobby parliament with Kiloh and Anna Clare today. The woodcraft folk have had their government grant stopped so we were off to try to persuade some MPs to do something about it. It turned out, though, that I had got the day wrong and the lobbying was yesterday. So we took the opportunity to go bowling and now I'm using the time before meeting Rupert for a movie trip to do a bit of blogging.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://society.guardian.co.uk/children/story/0,,1439170,00.html">article by David Batty</a> says that some people think they took away the woodcraft folk's money because they were against the war. It can't have been a surprise that woodies were against the war, though. I mean, we spend a lot of our time sitting round campfires singing about things like the H-bomb's thunder and how we're going to lay down our arms and how you've got axes so we'll get axes too.... Like, woodcraft folk are against war, full stop. Anyway, hope they see sense. Kiloh and Anna reckon they might, seeing as how the election is coming up. I kind of think, though, that we've got another goverment who would put me in the category of 'wouldn't vote for us anyway'.</p>
