<h3 id="a011760">jeds (sic) apostrophe</h3>

<p>Back in December 2002, I posted this note from Jed about <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0061589/">Dont Look Back</a>:</p>

<blockquote>I just read your blog on apostrophes and wondered if you are interested in my apostrophe story: A million years ago when I was making TV Commercials with <span class="caps">D.A.P</span>ennebaker (he of ‘Primary’ and ‘Woodstock’ then and ‘Startup.com’ now) I also helped Penne in the closing post production on his film of Bob Dylans English tour. I designed the poster (now a collector’s item - and No, I don’t have a copy) and took his title ‘Don’t Look Back’ and did an all caps title that became ‘DONT <span class="caps">LOOK BACK</span>’. We had a lot of talk about it ( and I have some current emails from Penne discussing it again) and when it came out Safire of The New York Times went ballistic - never mind the movie, he wrote a whole column blasting the movie just for that missing apostrophe. I was quoted by Penne as saying something like ‘Well, we wanted to be controversial’ (which I’m sure I never said!). But today, all over the world that movie and my poster are still working together quite well without the aid of that apostrophe</blockquote>

<p>Last night I went to see the movie at the <span class="caps">NFT </span>and I found that the programme notes mentioned that 'Jed Falby. the advertising executive who copperplated the poster with Pennebaker' was the one who suggested dropping the apostrophe.</p>

<p>Looks like one of Jed's stories was true!</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p>PS Enjoyed the film, which had a decent and enthusiastic audience (they applauded at the end!). In fact, I sometimes found it hard to distinguish the reverential audiences in the movie from the audience in the cinema.</p>

<p><span class="caps">PPS</span> One key scene is the one where Dylan is annoyed because somebody threw a glass. I looked up the movie on <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0061589/">imdb</a> (where there's a note saying 'orthographically correct title' for the Lynne Trusses of the world) and was amused to find that it had been Joan Baez who threw the glass cos she was fed up with Dylan.</p>
