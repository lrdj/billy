<p>Enjoyed this from the <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002495.html#more">Language Log</a>. Must use that closing in a letter soon (if I ever write a letter again, of course)</p>

<h3 id="a011812">missing the boos</h3>

<p>Just read a short <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/bobdylan/tvradio/nodirectionhome/interview2/">interview with DA Pennebaker</a> about No Direction Home. He says he didn't really notice the negativity of audiences. This is what he said when asked whether he really didn't hear the booing:</p>

<p><q>I hadn't noticed it. It's hard to tell booing from cheering in a way and I'm up there on stage so there's a lot of noise - I'm in the middle of The Band. Maybe I heard it and hadn't thought about it. It just didn't seem reasonable to me in view of how marvellous that music was.</q></p>

<h3 id="a011811">cold and far from home</h3>

<p>Managed to catch a cold in time for the first day of teaching yesterday. Did a fair bit of dripping, thought I was going to faint a couple of times, and I was definitely a bit fuzzier than usual, but the students were bright and interested.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I'm thoroughly excited by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/bobdylan/tvradio/nodirectionhome/">No Direction Home</a>, Martin Scorcese's documentary about Bob Dylan (part 1 last night, part 2 tonight). I showed the students Jed's apostropheless poster yesterday and had to stop myself going on about Dylan too long. I assured them that I'm not a Dylan nerd, but I should have admitted that I am working on it. I enjoyed the opening bit where he spoke about being on an odyssey taking things in on his way home. I've added this snippet to tomorrow's 'Meaning and Understanding' handout:</p>

<p><q>I was born <span class="caps">VERY </span>far from where I’m supposed to be and so I’m on my way home</q></p>

<h3 id="a011810">careless illustrators</h3>

<p>Just enjoyed receiving this from a university staff email list:</p>

<p><q>Illustration have lost their skeleton!  If you know where it is please phone me</q></p>
