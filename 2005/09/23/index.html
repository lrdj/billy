<h2>September 23, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a011799">The Glasgow School</h3>

<p>With all the chaos of a new academic year, added to by the effects of having changed campuses, there's no time for blogging at the moment. Even so, I'm enjoying <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007Y88D0/">The Glasgow School</a> so much I've got to tell whoever I'm communicating with by typing this. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/fridayreview/story/0,12102,1533116,00.html">This review</a> has things in it I don't agree with, but I do think it communicates the excitement of a band who always sound like you've just dropped the radio and it's falling apart as it bounces down the stairs. Hadn't thought about the lyrical connection with Morrissey but it's really obvious now.</p>

<p>I have two main memories of Orange Juice. One is crowding round a phone at an appointed time in a record shop in Aberdeen ('The Other Record Shop', for those who might remember) because those nice people at Postcard had agreed that they would play us an unobtainable Orange Juice track at that time. The other is seeing them play the day after some nasty incident (was it a mugging?) so that Edwyn was wearing a big eye-patch. Am I remembering right that they had borrowed a guitar for the evening? ('The bitter comes out better...')</p>

<p>B-)</p>
