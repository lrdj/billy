<h3 id="a011699">kiloh</h3>

<p>While I'm here, I've heard from another person with the first name Kiloh (the maiden name of a great-grandma in Aberdeen) who passed on a bit of etymological info:</p>

<p><q>Yes, Killoh (with two l's) is derived from the same "Kellog" as mine.  Even going further back it's from Cel (Celtic?) which refers to the bog around which the family was established.  So the name actually translates as "from the swamp"  yippee!</q></p>

<p>This explains why the name is sometimes written with two l's.</p>

<h3 id="a011698">starting up again</h3>

<p>I've had a few real 3-D people comment on the lack of posts now so I guess it's time to get going again. I expect I'll post more after Monday when I'll be spending more time sitting among the unpacked crates in my new office.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I'm at a conference trying to understand the apparent lack of recursion in Piraha syntax despite its obvious presence in the semantics of their utterances and thoughts, and keeping up with family life by email. Here's part of an update from Ohna on Apoa's first day back at school:</p>

<p><q>First day of school this morning was very typical. I asked her to make sure she had all her things packed last night, but of course as she was about to leave, she realised she didn't have her travel pass sorted, or her mobile phone or any money &amp; I forgot to make her a packed lunch!!</q></p>
