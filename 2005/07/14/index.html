<p>Well, the groovy new phone is going back to the shop tomorrow and they're bringing me a new one. Still, I've already had a fair amount of photo fun (helped by both girls being off school today) and spent around a day working out how to do things and getting my old contacts onto the new phone. Now I'm about to spend half a day getting them back again. B-)</p>

<p>And Robbie and I have exchanged photos between here and Cyprus. I'm glad to see <a href="http://www.robbiebushe.co.uk">Robbie</a> is blogging again. Got to work out that Cyprus/Hastings lifeshare for him.</p>

<h3 id="a009501">English language</h3>

<p>I've just been looking through one of Apoa's English books. She's looking at etymology and language variation and change. It's really impressive how it moves from one interesting topic to another. Her current homework is to write a letter to Prince Charles to try to persuade him that the English language syllabus shouldn't just be about literature. One line she's taking is to point out that if you don't do language work you can't really understand Beowulf. Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.qca.org.uk/11775.html"><span class="caps">QCA</span></a> are consulting on what should be in the various English curricula.</p>

<h3 id="a009500">popping spoffles</h3>

<p>I don't believe this but I like it anyway (from those bad <a href="http://www.popbitch.com">popbitch</a> people):</p>

<p><q>Many moons ago, when Hugh Laurie and Sir Stephen of Fry were just becoming 'known', they were interviewed on a <span class="caps">BBC </span>radio show. Mr Fry asked what the foam covers on the end of the mics were called. To which Mr Laurie said, 'They're called 'Spoffles' and they prevent what's known as 'Popping'. Mr Fry, the Host and the Engineer were all impressed by Mr Laurie's knowledge and the interview continued.</q></p>

<p><q>Years passed, and once again Fry and Laurie were in a radio studio. The Engineer said something like he'll just adjust the Spoffle. Mr Laurie says, 'The what?' And the Engineer explains that this is what the foam things are called. 'Good Lord,' laughs Mr Laurie, 'I made that word up on the spot years ago in a studio!'</q></p>
