<h2>August  4, 2006</h2>


<h3 id="a013207">a tale of two saunas</h3>

<p>It's a busy summer. Last week I was at a conference in Finland having a sauna in the woods and diving into a beautiful lake as the sun went down. This week I'm in a field in Kent with a few thousand young people from all over the world who have gathered together to change it. There is a home-made sauna here, built by some of the Finnish delegation. I haven't checked it out yet but hope to in the next day or two.</p>

<p>I started the camp as coordinator for a village containing 120 people, half from Norf London and half from Bad Doberan in Germany. Today, though, we had 'Governance Day' and after some discussion about how the camp is being run (apparently, I'm 'not controlling enough' which I kind of think of as a good thing) I have been deposed and two younger people are in charge. I could think about mounting a coup but instead I've sneaked off for a bit of blogging. I'll update you later but we are currently leaderless. The German leader lost interest straight away and the English leader made a few decisions (adults do all cooking tonight and get to bed by 10.30 - don't tell her we're all very keen on this) then proposed an anarchic system with no central authority (I don't think this sounds too different from my regime) and now says she wants to stand down. She hasn't found a replacement yet, though. She asked Val whose response was as direct as ever: 'Wouldn't touch it with a bargepole mate!'</p>

<p>B-)</p>
