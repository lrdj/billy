<h3 id="a012524">secondary transfer</h3>

<p>No news yet about where Kiloh will be going to school next year. We had all thought the letter would be arriving today and I thought it might have when I saw one letter addressed to Ohna with Kiloh's initials after it. As Ohna's in Australia and it'll be the middle of her night when Kiloh opens it, I wanted to make sure I had the right envelope so I phoned the council and found that they're putting them in the post today so it'll be tomorrow or the next day before we get it. Hope it's not tomorrow as I'll be away until night-time. Do I make her wait or have her open it while I'm on the other end of the phone?</p>

<h3 id="a012523">strike</h3>

<p>I'm on <a href="http://www.natfhe.org.uk/?id=hepay200607">strike</a> next Tuesday. Luckily, a student mentioned it in a tutorial. I hadn't had time yet to read the emails from <span class="caps">NATFHE, </span>one of which had the info. It would be typical of an academic not to know he was on strike because he hadn't read the email yet. I wouldn't faint if I found out that more than one academic uses the day to catch up on some work.</p>

<p>One depressing aspect of this is how little anyone seems to care when academics go on strike. How many of you know about the long-running <a href="http://www.natfhe.org.uk/?id=lonmetun">dispute</a> and academic boycott of London Met, for example?</p>

<p>There has been some national coverage of the coming strike and assessment boycott on the <span class="caps">BBC </span>and national papers, but it seems indicative to me that the first info on media coverage on the website is that 'news of balloting appeared in the Belfast Newsletter, Portsmouth News and elsewhere'</p>

<h3 id="a012521">McClosure</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2063360,00.html">TImes - McDonald's closing 25 restaurants</a></p>

<p>Oisin will be pleased about this. We traumatised him last week when McDonald's was the only option for a snack after swimming.</p>
