<h2>June  9, 2006</h2>


<h3 id="a012834">mistletoe and whine</h3>

<p>Now that I'm back to work and some of our members are a bit <a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/specialreports/lecturerspay/story/0,,1793058,00.html">p'ed off</a>** I don't have any time to blog as I'm marking like crazy internally and externally, but I couldn't not tell you about this which I read in the Guardian's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/wrap/subscribe">Wrap</a> this morning:</p>

<p><q><span class="caps">MISTLETOE AND WHINE</span></q></p>

<p><q>Gordon Ramsay is back in the papers - but this time, he's not the one doing the swearing. The chef tricked Sir Cliff Richard into criticising one of his own wines at a blind tasting for a Channel 4 show. Sir Cliff was not amused, using a phrase the Wrap will not repeat in a filtered email.</q></p>

<p><q>However, we can report the singer's verdict on a bottle of Portuguese red from his vineyard, Vida Nova. 'That's rubbish. I wouldn't pay for that, it's tainted, it's insipid. It tastes like vinaigrette. I'd never buy that.'</q></p>

<p><q>Ramsay is now using Vida Nova as vinaigrette at his restaurant at Claridge's, where he claims it 'goes down tremendously well with the tuna'.</q></p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p>**I can see their point since we've just accepted a deal worse than those breakers away at Ulster got and the same as the one that was out of the question a week ago, but I think they're being a bit hard on our leadership. Personally, I'd have had the stomach to carry on a bit longer, though.</p>
