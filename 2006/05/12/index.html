<h2>May 12, 2006</h2>


<h3 id="a012756">enron</h3>

<p>Left <a href="http://www.channel4.com/sport/microsites/A/allinthegame/">all in the game</a> in the middle, to make a pear and rhubarb crumble among other things, but came back for the end. The story was fairly predictable but there was some good writing and Ray was on top form swearing away. Could use this programme to explore the various meanings of the 'c' word (no, not 'cool, students).</p>

<p>But the really good film I saw this week was <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0413845/">Enron - The Smartest Guys In The Room</a> (yes, folks, that's irony). An amazing story, very well told. There's so much you could say about it but a few things particularly intrigued me.</p>

<p>First was to see how they started digging a little hole and ended up digging something big enough for the whole company to fall into, and to drag in Arthur Andersen, a whole pile of banks and the state of California with them. Hadn't realised they were responsible for the 'Governator'.</p>

<p>Second, was the connection they made between the Enron traders and the <a href="http://www.new-life.net/milgram.htm">Milgram experiments</a> (where more than 50% of ordinary folks turned out to be willing to electrocute strangers to the point at which they risked death just because a man in a white coat told them to). Funnily enough, I was just recently watching the start of <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0087332/">Ghostbusters</a> which was also inspired by Milgram.</p>

<p>Finally, it was that queasy feeling as you'd laughed at the evil idiots** for a couple of hours and were then reminded that it really wasn't funny at all, particularly when you saw what they did to Californians and to the ordinary employees who were completely shafted by them. As usual, the ordinary folk were left with nothing while the guys who caused the mess were cashing in their millions on the way to their cells.</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p>**not including the guy whose suicide started the film</p>
