<h3 id="a012768">select committee</h3>

<p><a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,,1776137,00.html?gusrc=rss">Education Guardian - lecturers and employers called to select committee</a></p>

<p>Mmm, wonder where this is heading....</p>

<p>Among other things, I'm refereeing a journal article and working on a book proposal today, two things that would be struggling for my attention if I had my usual pile of marking to do. I'm trying to make as much use of this time as I can but I'm also hoping the dispute ends soon. I don't want to be marking through the summer (or later).</p>

<p>There seems to be quite a bit of variation around the country just now. Some universities are getting very nasty - threatening to dock or even stop pay. I've also met some people whose departments aren't going to be affected much. But it does look like most students will not be having their work marked at the moment. So far, I have three assessment boards at two institutions booked as provisional (only happening if the dispute is over in time) and some marking at one institution which will be going on as normal (the union's position being that we should do any external work but not do anything internal).</p>

<p>In between the work, I nipped down to the bike shop to get lights for the kids' bikes and enjoyed watching someone test-driving a brompton on Lamb's Conduit Street (she seemed sceptical but was being persuaded by an enthusiastic pal - I resisted telling her about Erica's broken arm sustained while pulling a glove on with her teeth while bromptoning). Lamb's Conduit Street used to be famous  for being the only street in London that's one-way for cars and two-way for bikes (as well as for the water supply, of course). Picked up Apoa's 'what I need for food tech tomorrow' text while I was there and was delighted to see that we already have everything she needs, including, somewhat unexpectedly, a pineapple.<br />
