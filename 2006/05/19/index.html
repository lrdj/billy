<h2>May 19, 2006</h2>


<h3 id="a012782">hey bike boy!</h3>

<p>Listening to Perry Haines (no, I didn't think you'd remember him) performing his one 'hit' (that's 'hit' as in 10 of us in Aberdeen liked it) and thinking any bike fans out there will want to know what kind of machine I just signed a credit agreement for. It's a <a href="http://www.ridgebackbikes.co.uk/bikes/bike.asp?bikeID=174">ridgeback bullit</a></p>

<p>So far, very nimble - much more zippy than the Trek that was driven through on Wednesday and giving me a much more aerobic ride than I'm used to. Reminds me of what cycling used to be like before I got myself an inappropriate vehicle. Ideally, I'd have liked to get a proper road bike but I need something that will cope with the <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/paulb143/parkland.htm">Parkland Walk</a>, <a href="http://www.gardenvisit.com/g/tren2.htm">Trent Park</a> and other occasional bits of off-road riding.</p>

<p>Had a nice cycle home on the new machine, ruined slightly by the fight between two girls I tried to stop on the way. They were somewhere around 12 or 13, I'd say, and one was being seriously violent to the other while her friend added the occasional kick. I was in between them telling them to stop but I had obviously managed my trick of becoming completely invisible. A grownup who knew them was there and doing absolutely nothing about it, but then a few others came along and tried to be slightly more effective than me.</p>

<p>B-)</p>
