<h3 id="a012456">'Dettol protects. Fact!'</h3>

<p>This blog hasn't been too linguistic recently, partly because I have <a href="http://billydug.typepad.com/londonlanguage/">London Language</a> as an alternative outlet, as well as lots of opportunities to talk about language in class.</p>

<p>I got a really nice example from Apoa the other morning. We were discussing facts and propositions (I'm sure all parents chat about things like this with their kids over breakfast, right?) and we were agreeing that facts exist but that we can never know for sure which things are facts, when she said, 'Dettol protects. Fact!'</p>

<p>For the pragmatists among you, it strikes me as an interesting echoic usage illsutrating something rather than saying it, and also to be a good example of linguistic underdeterminacy - how do you work out the relationship between the two bits, and what exactly does 'dettol protects' mean?</p>

<p>Went to see <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0377107/">Proof</a> last night, followed by a talk with John Madden, who reminded me that maths is one area where you can prove things conclusively. One big issue with the film, of course, is that they can't tell us anything about the maths in it as we wouldn't have a clue about what it meant.</p>

<p>Just updated the site a bit, btw. Some new links below and a few handouts from this year's teaching.</p>

<h3 id="a012455">all roads lead to Haldane</h3>

<p>We got the message on Wednesday that visiting hours ended at 8pm so we all rushed to Hampstead to visit Nicki and Haldane. We came from three different starting places but made it on time. Apoa enjoyed me interrupting her guitar ensemble to ask if she could leave early as 'she has to go and see a doughnut'. We made it past the security and gathered behind the curtain to introduce ourselves. I was particularly excited as I got to do a bit of nappy-changing. He is, of course, much smaller in the flesh than in the photos but just as cute.</p>

<h3 id="a012454">BSL degree course</h3>

<p><a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,,1706123,00.html">Education Guardian - BA in Sign Language</a></p>

<p>I wonder how many people will go for this. I've always thought that they should introduce sign language in the national curriculum. If they taught <span class="caps">BSL </span>to kids when they start primary, they'd enjoy it, learn it easily, be happily bilingual, think positively about language learning and be able to communicate with <span class="caps">BSL </span>signers.</p>
