<p>Ohna's in France (being interviewed by Liberation about short film-making in Britain, among other things!) so she couldn't take me up on one of her christmas presents, which was a ticket to see <a href="http://www.belleandsebastian.com/">Belle and Sebastian</a> in Cambridge. Robbie came instead. He even got away early so we had time for a pre-gig beer and fish and chips in the Eagle (famous as the place where Crick and Watson came up with the double helix idea and for the names of airmen carved into the ceiling during World War II). Belle and Sebastian were great. As they said, they've got a <span class="caps">LOAD </span>of songs to choose from now. After one person had yelled 'We Rule The School!' all night, they played one line of it and then stopped saying 'och, we'll do it tomorrow'. The locals didn't like all the references to braininess, lectures, etc. The woman next to me said 'Everybody who comes here goes on about that, even though most of the people here are locals!'</p>

<p>The support were Brakes who were great. Most songs were about a minute long. The final song, was introduced as 'a short one'. It was called 'comma comma comma full stop'. I liked it so much I bought the record! (And they covered a Camper van Beethoven song, Dug)*</p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.belleandsebastian.com/">Belle and Sebastian band site</a> we <span class="caps">MAY </span>listen to the album before it comes out if we find it on the web.<br />
 <br />

<p>*Dug planted the idea of this in my head but thought he shouldn't be going to a gig in Cambridge on the day his second kid is due.</p>
