<h3 id="a012264">balderdash and piffle</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/wordhunt/"><span class="caps">BBC </span>- Balderdash and Piffle</a></p>

<p>This was an enjoyable programme about the <span class="caps">OED.</span> The main idea is for viewers and the programme makers to work together to find new info to update the <span class="caps">OED.</span> They focused on words where the earliest citation seems too recent, e.g. the earliest citation they've got for 'pear-shaped' is 1983 and the earliest for 'ploughman's lunch' is 1970. I loved the story about 'ploughman's lunch' (the phrase was invented in the late 50's/early 60's as a way of promoting British cheeses) and the literature and beer mats. And I especially liked the scene where Victoria Coren found the phrase in a letter and some minutes while searching the archive with her big white gloves on. The piece on Polari by Mark Ravenhill was also good.</p>

<h3 id="a012260">back to work</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ohna/sets/1733307/"><img alt="ny0506roof.jpg" src="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/billy/images/ny0506roof.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>

<p>There were a few funny tummies at Christmas, as well as a broken boiler (which chose christmas eve to pack in) and Hogmanay was also a bit sick. Donal had mumps so his 18th birthday party/hogmanay combo was cancelled and replaced with a small neighbours' party. Andrew caught it (them?) too and we had a rather strange evening with people disappearing for lie-downs and to pop into other parties before we all got onto the bathroom roof to watch the fireworks and toast the new year. We had a quick game of Buzz (playstation music quiz) after which Ohna suggested that reducing Dad's Competivitiveness might be a resolution to go alongside my main one about improving my contribution to the quality of family life.</p>

<p>The last couple of days have been really nice with all of us at home and no school or anything. It's ending soon, though. Apoa's back to school today. We weren't sure whether she'd be able to get up after having adjusted to late mornings and nights, so we were amazed to hear her up making breakfast an hour early at 5.30. She then went back to bed and was pretty tired by the time she caught her train. I'm back to work today but working at home before getting back on campus tomorrow. We've pencilled in a break later on to start taking down decorations and the tree. Kiloh's back on Thursday so she's <span class="caps">PS2</span>ing like crazy in the meantime.</p>
