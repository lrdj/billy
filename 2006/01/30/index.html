<p>My favourite line in this is:</p>

<p>â€œIf you want to be cool you have to live, and if you smoke you will be dead, and that is not cool, to be dead.â€? </p>

<p>Well, it's Chinese New Year, so naturally we celebrated by attacking a haggis-shaped pinata that Kiloh made and then eating haggis neaps and tatties with a bit of Rabbie on the side (Kiloh was slightly disappointed as she says she prefers the meaty haggis but had to eat the veggie one since she's just joined Verena on the meat-free side of the family). We think it's been a productive weekend, but that's partly cos we didn't really go out and have any fun. The kids did that on their own yesterday. The closest I got was half an hour in the garden with a cup of tea and Nobuyoshi Araki. Apart from getting the handouts ready for tomorrow, my big breakthroughs were to get the tax return 80% done - there are always a couple of bits of paper you can't find just when you need them so it's desperate phone call time tomorrow yet again -  and to finally fix the puncture I've been cycling around on for a couple of weeks. I've been calling it a 'slow' puncture but it didn't look slow when I took the tube out of the tyre. Hope it's still inflated in the morning.</p>
