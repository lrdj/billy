<h3 id="a005601">Oscar nominations</h3>

<p> We're quite excited that Keisha Castle-Hughes got nominated for an Oscar and Jed picked up on the nice example of structural ambiguity in the <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/snowmail/">Snowmail</a> report on it:</p>

<p><q>Thank you Billy - that's fascinating reading. And being the language hot dog that you are you must have loved the quote for Whale Rider: '...Castle-Hughes was discovered by a casting director who visited her school and had no previous acting experience...'</q></p>

<p><q>It's the only time of the year I wish I had Sky to watch the whole terrible but unmissable award show live. We used to have Oscar parties to watch it all through the night!</q></p>

<h3 id="a005600">Apoa in the snow</h3>

<p> Apoa went to her very last secondary transfer assessment yesterday, which was a music audition. We came out of the school around 5pm to find heavy snow, thunder and lightning waiting for us. We enjoyed the traditional winter pursuit of standing at the bus stop while no bus comes, followed by the bus that crawls slowly past without stopping. Two and a half hours and a combination of bussing and walking and stopping off at nando's later, we were home, where we were greeted by a snowman (or what was left of one after the cheeky boys next door had been round). It's all melting around me as I write so I hope the kids are making the most of it while they can.</p>

<p>B-)</p>
