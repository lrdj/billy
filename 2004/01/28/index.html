<h3 id="a005599">like Kiloh in the movies</h3>

<p>Yesterday I had a chat with a neighbour as she cleaned up after someone broke her car window and tried to steal her prescription glasses(!). If this was a movie, we'd have known that was going to be significant at some point. This morning, Kiloh fell on her way to school and got a bit of the glass in her knee. It was easily removeable, luckily (and lucky Kiloh spotted it as I didn't notice at first) and she was very grateful after it was cleaned up.</p>

<h3 id="a005598">the fox in the snow</h3>

<p>We were woken up last night by a bizarre sound which turned out to be a fox hanging out outside the house opposite and wailing in distress. It was like a cross between a dog's bark and a cat meowing in distress, maybe the kind of noise you'd use in an animated movie for a baby dinosaur. Very strange. It left when I looked outside but came back as soon as I went back upstairs. Of course, I've been listening to <a href="http://www.jeepster.co.uk/showdisc.php?id=1??tsection=belleandsebastian"> this</a> today</p>

<h3 id="a005597">"pleasures are like poppies spread..."</h3>

<p>Had a great Burns night at the weekend, the first one we've done with kids involved. Everyone joined in and some with great gusto. The kids all memorised small four-liner ones (2 graces and 1 little witticism about the joys of a highland welcome). We consumed decent but not outrageous amounts of usquabae, including some of Bonnie Prince Charlie's liqueur (in Edinburgh Fog as well as on its own - no rusty nails, though). If you fancy reading a bit of the bard, <a href="http://www.robertburns.org">this</a> is one of many well-stocked sites.</p>
