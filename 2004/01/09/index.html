<h3 id="a005590">one final push....</h3>

<p>Apoa made it to the second exam stage for the last school she's trying for. At least one of her friends didn't, which is a right bloody bore.</p>

<p>Last night the kids pretended they'd heard that she'd got through, which is the kind of fate-tempting thing a grown-up would never do, so I'm glad she did make it. When she phoned to tell me, I got to pretend that I didn't believe her and thought she was just pulling my leg again. So now she's got one more exam, one music audition and one 'assessment', which is an exam for a school that's not selective but tries to take kids from all the ability ranges. Can't wait till she's done it all. But then I guess Kiloh's turn will come round before we know it.</p>

<h3 id="a005589">high culture, low treatment</h3>

<p>I've been busy as you can tell by the gap between this and the previous posting. Lots of postable stuff has happened but you know, life. I still don't have time to write this, but there does seem to be a general feeling that the later on a Friday it gets the more justifiable time-wasting is, which seems like a bit of a paradox but whatever.</p>

<p>Anyway, I won't tell you about all the stuff that happened over the last few weeks. Instead, I'll start by venting my frustration after spending an hour and a half this morning standing in the cold waiting to buy a day ticket at the Royal Opera House (while reading 'Crime and Punishment' - in for a penny...) only to be told when I got to the sales point that it was one ticket per person - something they didn't mention when I phoned to ask about it last week. I didn't want to go without Ohna and I have an overdeveloped 'let's-just-deal-with-it' module and didn't think about kicking up a fuss until too late, when I phoned up too late for them to do anything about it. So I left with nothing but memories...</p>
