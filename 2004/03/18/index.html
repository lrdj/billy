<h3 id="a005603">a worm's eye view</h3>

<p> I've been thinking that I might have to abandon this blog, but I thought I could afford 30 seconds to forward this on.</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p>The Wrap: A worm's eye view</p>

<p>18 March 2004</p>

<p>Terrorists declare war on evil, writes Andrew Brown. We should know better</p>

<p>Should terrorists be able to influence the outcome of elections? In one sense - and contrary to the impression you may have received this week - the right believes fervently that they should. Every advertisement suggesting that Mr Bush should be re-elected because of September 11 is based on the premise that terrorist crime should influence American voters. It just mustn't influence them to vote for his enemies, as appears to have happened in Spain.</p>

<p>Assume, for the sake of argument, that the election of a Socialist government is exactly what the bombers of Madrid intended. Should this have stopped the Spanish from voting as they did?</p>

<p>The first point to make is that if this is what they wanted, we are not dealing, in the words of one favourite cliche, with mindless terrorism. We are dealing with people much more effective at manipulating foreign electorates than the Bush government, which never managed to persuade more than a small minority of the Spanish people that the invasion of Iraq was wise and justified.</p>

<p>Fair enough. We are dealing with a subtle and determined enemy. Is it still wrong to do anything they want us to do? If it is, we're in dead trouble, because it would make them subtle, determined, and omniscient as well, since they would never want us to do anything which might in fact benefit us. Such terrorists would be figures of superhumanly gifted malevolence.</p>

<p>A worrying number of Bushies do write and behave as if their "War on Terror" were fought against supernatural powers. Barbara Amiel, for example, had an extraordinary rant in Monday's Telegraph: "Eta, Hezbollah and their many lookalikes have one thing in common. They all partake of the satanic nature of the terrorist culture ... a Satan that is evil incarnate, who can seize men's souls and turn them into his subordinates on earth."</p>

<p>She then goes on to compare Islamist terrorists unfavourably with the Nazis and the Stalinists, under whom "certain moral notions such as loyalty, conscience, support of the downtrodden or the innocence of the young, were never entirely dead even in that part of Satan's empire... such pinpricks in the darkness are missing from today's Satanists. No compunction mitigates or limits their murder. Only our actions on earth can stop them but their deeds are so transcendentally satanic that it genuinely leads to the invocation 'deliver us from evil'. One feels impelled to invoke the moral force of a deity against them."</p>

<p>Hang on. Let's take a few deep breaths here, Barbara. Al-Qaida has killed perhaps 10,000 people in the last ten years. Hitler and Stalin counted their victims in tens of millions. It is true that they appealed to some virtues to strengthen their vicious regimes, but so do the Islamists. "Loyalty, conscience, and the support of the downtrodden" are not confined to Nazis. They are some of the emotions appealed to by the jihadis and the recruiters of the suicide bombers.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old British suicide bomber Asif Mohammad Hanif said in the video released after his death, which was meant to justify his murders, "You spend the whole day in fields and then some dude comes with his truck and runs over it. How would you feel? You feel like standing him up, shooting him ... because you have worked for a whole day like that." This is hardly an appeal to an arcane religious principle. What Islam did was to persuade him, despite his British passport and education, that he had more in common with the wretched victims of the Gaza strip than with the free and democratic young people he blew up and mutilated.</p>

<p>Such people make a terrible weapon. But they are not forged in hell. They are made from recognisable human beings, with whom we were probably at school. Soldiering against injustice does seem more popular among young men than being a medical missionary. Our own culture glorifies the rebel, the misfit and the lone fighter against injustice. Jihadi Islam works with those materials. Suicide bombers are as often made in teenagers' bedrooms as in a mosque.</p>

<p>I hope and believe that Islam may be subverted by liberal capitalism, just as Christianity has been. But that happened by a change of hearts and minds, not a surrender to a head-on assault. No religion that has lasted 1,400 years can be exterminated by persecution: it can only be made more brutal and ignorant.</p>

<p>With all that said, I still think the new Spanish government should keep its troops in Iraq. We're all committed to imperialism now. Perhaps we shouldn't have conquered Iraq; I certainly wish we hadn't. But we did, and we must now help to run it as well as can be done. Throwing out Aznar, and Bush, and Blair, is not surrendering to the terrorists. It's an essential defence of democracy, by showing that in a democracy, people who lie their way into war will be punished. But pretending afterwards that the Iraq war didn't happen and that we can make it go away by withdrawing our troops is simply infantile.</p>
