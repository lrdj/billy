<h2>March 20, 2004</h2>


<h3 id="a005604">h*l*m*ts</h3>

<p>Well, I think I've decided to start blogging again. Here's one of many issues on which side with regard to I don't know where I stand (sorry, it's deliberately-weird-utterance day, translations on request):</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- Forwarded message follows &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>The London Cycling Campaign, in conjunction with the <span class="caps">CTC </span>(I've forgotten what this stands for), has produced a briefing document on why the current Private Members Bill seeking the compulsory use of cycle helmets for under sixteens should be opposed. </p>

<p>I have uploaded the document to our e-mail group...If anyone has difficulty accessing the document would like a copy, let me know and I will e-mail it to you direct. </p>

<p>I know that there has been some discussion on this list about the pros and cons of helmet wearing so I thought this document would help inform the debate. </p>

<p>The main reasons given for opposing the proposed law are: </p>

<p>The principal threats to children's lives are obesity, heart disease and other illnesses resulting in large part from inactivity. Cycling has a key role to play in preventing these illnesses. Less cycling through a helmet law would aggravate the situation. </p>

<p>- Cycling is a healthy activity, and the likelihood of serious head injury is widely exaggerated. </p>

<p>- Cycling becomes safer the more people who do it. Encouraging cycling is by far the most effective way of reducing risk of injury. </p>

<p>- Helmet promotion deters cycling and leads to poorer health. </p>

<p>- The benefits of helmets are greatly over-stated. </p>

<p>- Many other everyday activities could benefit more from helmets than cycling </p>

<p>- A helmet law would make it a crime for children to take part in a health-giving activity. </p>

<p>Best wishes</p>

<p>Stephen</p>
