<h3 id="a006457">'a linguisty jobbie'</h3>

<p>We had a lot of kids round on Halloween for some mass trick-or-treating. Even when we split them up, the groups were too big. As we were strolling between houses, JessieL asked me 'what's this linguisty jobbie Apoa's been telling me about?'</p>

<p>She was referring to the utterance 'Everybody doesn't like chocolate'. My students find it hard to believe that for some speakers it can mean 'not everybody likes chocolate' as well as 'nobody likes chocolate' (I've got a feeling I agreed with them once - maybe I've been contaminated by linguists). I promised I'd ask a few more folk.</p>

<p>At breakfast, we found 3 out of 4 people accepted both senses. Apoa was the odd one out and just found it weird. JessieL was incredibly articulate as she explained her opinion to Apoa:</p>

<p>'Technically, like if you're talking proper and everything, it just means that every single person doesn't like chocolate. But I can see that some people might say it sometimes and mean that not everybody likes it.'</p>

<p>It's a good illustration of the problems of investigating competence when all of your evidence has to be based on performance data (at least that's what I tell the students).</p>

<h3 id="a006456">a job for Robbie</h3>

<p>I'm really pleased that <a href="http://www.robbiebushe.co.uk/">Robbie</a> has got a new job. It's in Oxford and is part-time, 3 days a week. Another artist told me that she does 2 days a week and that you should never take on more than that if you want to do your own work, but Robbie thinks it will work so we'll see. I think it's really important that Robbie gets a chance to work seriously on his art, like when the main concern of the literary establishment was to 'get Mr. Eliot out of the bank'. (Where did I read about that?)</p>

<h3 id="a006455">back to blogging</h3>

<p>Well, there's been plenty to blog about recently but no time to do it. When lots of 'real' people and things are waiting for you to do stuff it's hard to justify sitting here typing for virtual entities.</p>

<p>But I've just been woken up on the point of bedtime by the sound of someone being beaten up outside and have been standing in the cold talking to the victim, the cops and a few other witnesses. The police radio was talking about a 'crack address' here but it sounded from what the others said more like he had got pissed and been beaten up by somebody he knew on his way home. Anyway, since I'm not sleepy any more, I'll add a message or two before I get dozy again.</p>
