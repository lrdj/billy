<h2>October 11, 2004</h2>


<h3 id="a006408">'time to resign...'</h3>

<p>Just read this on a local email group, from a former Haringey councillor and soon-to-be-ex-Labour Party member:</p>

<p>I thought I would take a quiet moment and announce my resignation from the Labour Party.</p>

<p>Many people have done this over the last few years, and I regret that they have not communicated on this.</p>

<p>There is actually no way of resigning in a way that feels as momentous as it did joining in the first place.</p>

<p>Phoning up Head Office and cancelling your direct debit just doesn’t have much of a ring to it, does it?</p>

<p>After 25 years you feel you want to at least make some sort of gesture. </p>

<p>The Party doesn’t meet any more locally (or if it does, it is in private and I am not invited) - so going along and resigning is not possible. Hopefully some of you are reading this. You guys may think it has been one of the longest goodbyes you've seen. I guess it has. Working in recent elections has been interesting.</p>

<p>Of course the Party has changed since I joined it to support the initiatives of the Campaign For Labour party Democracy, and the selection process of Labour candidates and sitting MPs. I was thrilled to be the union rep vote that got Jeremy Corbyn selected in North Islington. What a great MP he still is.</p>

<p>I found it very sad that our ward recently assisted in the automatic reselection of our own sitting MP without the ability to debate or ask her any questions. Not quite so democratic.</p>

<p>But some changes are too fundamental and cynical to allow. </p>

<p>I want to be independent, so will not be joining another Party. I am not leaving so I can now vote for another Party with a clean conscience. Getting people to vote is a challenge in itself, never mind trying to sell the Party's record. Local and national politics deserves better than this. Reform of Local Government is nowhere on the agenda. Domestic issues seem too crime-centred.</p>

<p>Expedience is the order of the day.</p>

<p>What clinched it for me was the idea of going along to the Human Rights Lawyers Association <span class="caps">AGM </span>tonight (being held ironically at Matrix Chambers) and still being a Labour Party member. Impeach the crusader. No more Holy Wars. Another chapter of unnecessary British Imperial history. Could be an interesting evening.</p>

<p>I know that this government has achieved a great deal in social and economic welfare, but these were not Tony Blair's achievements. Anybody who wants to be confirmed into the Church in their first year at university (I had other priorities I seem to remember) has me wondering. A full third term is not a good prospect. Smacks of over-confidence. </p>

<p>So - time to phone and cancel my direct debit then....</p>

<h3 id="a006407">Avril and the week before</h3>

<p><a title="Avril Lavigne tickets Wembley Arena - official Wembley site" href="http://www.whatsonwembley.com/htdocs/home_whatson.php?cc=76&amp;name=what's on&amp;event=208">Avril Lavigne at Wembley Arena - official Wembley site</a></p>

<p>Just got back from this. We all agreed it was better than SClubUnited, which is the only other concert the kids have been to. We had standing tickets but took advantage of the offer to be reseated at the side of the stage, since the kids wouldn't have seen anything from the floor. Us oldies particularly enjoyed the cover of Blur's <em>Song 2</em> with the bassist from Simple Plan on vocals and Avril on drums.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, we went to a remembrance service for families who had lost babies at the Whittington Hospital, as Apoa's guitar group were playing there. It was a simple service and obviously a lot of sadness there. The guitar group played beautifully.</p>

<p>Earlier still, Kiloh went to her circus class and Apoa missed hers to go bowling for Rachel's birthday.</p>

<p>All of this inspired us to rent a car for the weekend. I'm glad we did as it made all the moving around easier, and we even managed a quick visit to Ikea 10 mintues before they closed, where we picked up curtains and a rail etc. for Kiloh's room. But I must say it reminded me how crappy it is driving around and being close to all the angry drivers.</p>

<p>Yesterday was much quieter, but we managed to fit in a visit from Nicki and Clemmie, who enjoyed capering with her cousines.</p>

<p>Earlier in the week I learned a new German word, 'schnapszahl', when I turned 44. The kids think a 'double-digit' is really cool. Maybe this can be mentioned in my meaning class. To celebrate we went to St. John and the following night we went to a dinner hosted by Fergus Henderson and Anthony Bourdain which was great fun, even though the food wasn't very good (!!). The audience were mean enough to mention that in the question session.</p>

<p>Anyway, sorry to splurt out a whole week (well, bits of it) like that. I'll try to get back to daily postings from now on.</p>

<p>B-)</p>
