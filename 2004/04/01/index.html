<p>Well, I never made it as far as the Gang of Four.</p>

<p>Apoa has succumbed to a bug that's on the go around here and the puir wee craitur vommed all over her bed, her bedroom floor, her Beanos (tragedy), her pyjamas, the bathroom floor and the sink. The cats seemed a bit bemused as they watched me leap into action with my marigolds.</p>

<h3 id="a005609">Kurt's choice</h3>

<p> I'm enjoying the free CD with the week's <a href="http://www.nme.com">nme</a></p>

<p>It's called 'Kurt's choice' and claims to be 'the 13 tracks that made Nirvana', but it's still fun. It's Iggy Pop's 'Louie Louie' right now and I'm remembering where I was when I heard the news that Kurt had died, driving down from Aberdeen to Edinburgh (just approaching Stonehaven at the time) to catch a <a href="http://www.r.bushe.dial.pipex.com/"> Robbie</a> show.</p>

<p>I remember my feelings were an echo of the outrage I'd felt when Sid Vicious died and the mainstream newsfolk were unbelievably callous about it. For Kurt, the issue was not so much that they were being callous about another human being's death as that they thought the main issue was whether it was OK to like his work or not.</p>

<p>It seems like a long time ago, now, but not as long as the days of the Butthole Surfers. I'm enjoying 'sweat loaf' now and looking forward to 'John Wayne was a Nazi' by <span class="caps">MDC, </span>which will be followed by the Gang of Four doing 'At Home He Feels Like A Tourist', which meant everything to me about a quarter of a century ago but which I've hardly heard since.</p>
