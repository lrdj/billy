<h3 id="a006371">busy day</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.sohotheatre.com/plays/77.htm"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/privatepeaceful.jpg" alt="Private Peaceful" width="300" height=113" /></a></p>

<p>After a quiet day at home tidying up the spare room for next week's visit from Daniel and Gemma, and a quiet evening in with just Kiloh at night (Apoa was off sleeping over), with a visit from Clemmie, Dug and Nicki squeezed in (with a bit of guilt as I took advantage of their <span class="caps">SUV </span>for a quick stock-up on cat food), we had a really fun day today.</p>

<p>First we visited circus school where Apoa took a massive step forward in the battle against vertigo and learned how to turn around on the flying trapeze. Meanwhile Kiloh mastered the 'big star' on the static trapeze and developed her skills on the walking globe and whatever those funny things with two steps and four wheels are called. Then we resisted stopping off at Virgin on the way to the <a href="http://www.sohotheatre.com/homepage/default.htm">Soho Theatre</a>, where the matinee performance of Private Peaceful was followed with a discussion and question session with <a title="children's laureate" href="http://www.childrenslaureate.org/">Michael Morpurgo</a> (author of the novel), Simon Reade (writer and director of the play) and Paul Chequer (the one actor in the play). I've been to a fair number of these discussions and this was the liveliest and most fun, mainly because Michael Morpurgo is a right laugh and a great performer. When the host said we should be winding up soon, he said 'Why? I don't have anything on this evening, do you?' He capped it all by having his chair collapse under him near the end. His wife instantly leapt onto the stage, whipped out her camera and took a picture. She says it might appear on his <a title="children's laureate" href="http://www.childrenslaureate.org/">Children's laureate website</a> soon.</p>

<p>The play itself was really great. I could mention the few things I would have been tempted to change (there are always some of these) but the main thing to say is that the script and performance were great, totally involving and 'real'.</p>

<p>We followed that with a quick pizza stop on the way home and an almost instant passing-out from both kids when we got home. Maybe not the best prep for a busy week at school, but worth it imho.</p>

<h3 id="a006370">postal detour</h3>

<p>Message to Jed and Ruth:</p>

<p>Hi guys,</p>

<p>Do you remember back on the 12th of September when you went visiting as many artists as you could in one day in Somerset? And you sent us a lovely card about it?</p>

<p>We wanted to say thanks for the lovely card and thought you'd be interested to know that we received it on Friday after the card had taken a slight detour to Australia and back! It arrived with a note on the envelope saying:</p>

<p>'Missorted to Australia. Return <span class="caps">UK'</span></p>

<p>Well, at least it got here in the end!</p>

<h3 id="a006369">Pescarolos</h3>

<p>When I said 'a Pescarolo', I meant a car. I should add, though, that she'll also be playing with M. Henri Pescarolo himself who will be driving the car.</p>
