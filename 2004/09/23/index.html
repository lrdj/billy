<h3 id="a006358">the mosh pit revisited</h3>

<p>Emily from the <a href="http://www.nme.com">nme</a> phoned me yesterday to tell me I'd won two tickets to the launch night of <a href="http://www.koko.uk.com/events_details.htm#wednesday">club nme</a> at <a href="http://www.koko.uk.com/">Koko</a></p>

<p>She had them biked over to me which made me think they were maybe a bit worried about the turnout.</p>

<p>They were gold <span class="caps">VIP </span>tickets, so when we got there Andrew and I had a look for the <span class="caps">VIP </span>area. We eventually discovered that these were the kind of <span class="caps">VIP </span>tickets that let you jump the queue on the way in but not much else.</p>

<p>It's a lovely building and we had a great time. It was all quite relaxed in the beginning and we enjoyed that there wasn't much sense of preciousness about the people. By the end of the evening, we had maybe consumed one kola kube tequila shot too many (OK, I only had one but anyway), enjoyed the <a href="http://www.kaiserchiefs.co.uk/">Kaiser Chiefs</a>, joined the moshers for <a href="http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/entertainment/music/audioandvideo/s/118/118941_download_the_others_this_is_for_the_poor_single.html">The Others</a>, whose set ended with a full stage invasion, and I had been snogged by a delightful young lady who introduced herself to us by stealing large gulps of Andrew's drink.</p>

<p>It's got to be over a decade since I moshed (I'm sure it wasn't even called that then) and I have to say I really enjoyed it, especially the bit where my specs were being bent in two onto my eyes and the bit where I did my spectacular backwards tumble (starting from the floor, not the stage or anything). It wasn't packed, so we remembered that bit in <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0332379/">School of Rock</a> when Jack Black dives from the stage and the audience politely stand aside to let him land on his face.</p>
