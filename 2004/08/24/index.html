<h3 id="a006224">language and thought</h3>

<p>Another message from <a href="http://www.linguistlist.org"><span class="caps">LINGUIST</span></a>. I was shown a summary of this in The Economist on the flight back from Ibiza and it did indeed seem to be concluding that 'Whorf was right' which didn't seem to be justified by the brief summary. Not sure exactly how Dan Everett reaches his conclusion, though. Guess I'll ask him (but only if I get time to read the article first, of course).</p>

<p>------------------------</p>

<p>Many readers of this list may have seen today's <span class="caps">CNN </span>report on the<br />
Science article which was published yesterday on Piraha:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/science/08/19/science.counting.reut/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/science/08/19/science.counting.reut/index.html</a></p>

<p>The Science article reports on research carried out by Peter Gordon,<br />
along with me and my wife, Keren, several years ago to test my view<br />
that Piraha had no counting. Gordon confirmed that indeed Pirahas have<br />
no concept of counting and further refined my original ideas on the<br />
matter.</p>

<p>Gordon's conclusion in Science is that Piraha offers support for the<br />
Whorf hypothesis. While I believe that this is plausible, my own view<br />
is that the lack of counting must be seen in the larger cultural<br />
context and that when thus viewed in conjunction with the lack of<br />
color words, the lack of embedding, the simplest kinship system ever<br />
documented, and various other characteristics, a different,<br />
non-Whorfian picture emerges. The basic conclusion I reach is that<br />
culture constrains grammar in ways many of us have not previously<br />
imagined. I take this to be an argument against, for example,<br />
Universal Grammar, at least the more widely-accepted versions of it.</p>

<p>Anyone interested in reading on this further (and the Piraha case does<br />
seem to be getting a lot of attention from various countries, based on<br />
my email folder this morning), my paper 'Cultural Constraints on<br />
Grammar in Piraha', currently under review, is available from my<br />
University of Manchester website at:</p>

<h3 id="a006222">the n-word</h3>

<p>Recent post to <a href="http://www.linguistlist.org"><span class="caps">LINGUIST</span></a> from Karen Chung:</p>

<p>There's an online written and audio report from Minnesota Public Radio, dated August 8, 2004, entitled <em>The n-word</em>, by Brandt Williams, at:</p>

<p><a href="http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2004/06/28_williamsb_nword/">http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2004/06/28_williamsb_nword/</a></p>

<p>One quote from an interviewee that especially impressed me from a phonetic and sociolinguistic point of view:</p>

<blockquote><p>You know why at times they don't realize how the word offends Afro American people? Simple reason. They don't say the word pretty as we do!' says Simmons. 'They got to hear that 'r'. That 'r' is what makes us go irate. Instant irate. 'You no-good nigger!' And I say, whoa man! And he turn around and say, well y'all use it. And I say y'all don't say it as pretty as we. That's why. We gotta hear that 'r'. When you hear us call each other 'nigga', you don't hear the 'r'.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The report includes excerpts from an interview with linguist Robin Lakoff, and quotes from comedian Richard Pryor.</p>

<p>The reporter says at the beginning of the report that he is African-American, but he is not identifiable as such from his accent, which sounds like unmarked Minnesotan to me.</p>

<p>No registration is required to access the report.</p>

<h3 id="a006219">Shatner strikes again</h3>

<p>My web presence is about to go through an overhaul. Just got back from holiday to find that <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com">Dug</a> has carried out phase one by moving the blog over to <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Moveable Type</a></p>

<p>Things will be changing a bit round here when I get time to play with it all.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I need to tell you all to go to <a href="http://www.shatnerhasbeen.com">www.shatnerhasbeen.com</a> and listen to previews of the new William Shatner album produced by Ben Folds. Excellent version of Common People in the style he made famous on The Transformed Man.</p>

<p>B-)</p>
