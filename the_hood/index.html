<h3 id="a011989">primary people power</h3>

<p>Last year, one of the classes at Kiloh's school were looking at environmental issues and became interested in what happens to batteries when we throw them away. They were horrified when they found out what happens after you throw a battery in the bin. I went in to class with another grownup to talk about it with them. The kids set up a box at school where everyone could bring their batteries and another grownup has been driving to Barnet where they have a proper battery disposal scheme to get rid of them. The kids also wrote letters to various people including the council about it. Last week, they were awarded a <a href="http://www.haringey.gov.uk/council/strategiesandpolicies/better_haringey/better_haringey_awards_2005.htm">Better Haringey</a> award for 'Best environmental innovation'. The next step is to write to the council again and point out that it would be odd if they didn't introduce a scheme to dispose of batteries properly after they've given this award for this reason.</p>

<h3 id="a005607">birth of a naturalist</h3>

<p>Yesterday afternoon I was amazed in our local park and left Ohna a whispered voicemail message:</p>

<p><q>I'm standing about 10 yards away from a heron. I've never been this close to one in the wild before. It doesn't seem bothered by people at all. Even kids aren't scaring it away.</q></p>

<p>A bit later, Ohna left me a message saying she couldn't make out what I'd said. What was I near? A <span class="caps">CLOWN</span>?</p>

<p>I prefer what Ohna thought I'd said. Who knows, maybe one day I will see a clown in the wild?</p>

<h3 id="a005598">the fox in the snow</h3>

<p>We were woken up last night by a bizarre sound which turned out to be a fox hanging out outside the house opposite and wailing in distress. It was like a cross between a dog's bark and a cat meowing in distress, maybe the kind of noise you'd use in an animated movie for a baby dinosaur. Very strange. It left when I looked outside but came back as soon as I went back upstairs. Of course, I've been listening to <a href="http://www.jeepster.co.uk/showdisc.php?id=1??tsection=belleandsebastian"> this</a> today</p>
