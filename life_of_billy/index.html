<h3 id="a014160">nature notes</h3>

<p>Don't get excited. I'm not saying I'm going to get back to posting regularly again. I'm still prioritising life over blogging ;-)</p>

<p>But I thought I should log that I just witnessed a crow attacking a heron in Regent's Park. I was coming up to the gates where my route from town joins the inner circle, heard a squawking and screeching and looked up to see a very strange outline in the sky. It was a heron with wings and legs spread out randomly dropping towards me as if coming in to land. It righted itself and arrowed over my head pursued by an angry crow.</p>

<p>Earlier this year I heard woodpecker-like sounds two days in a row on my way to get the paper and decided to keep my eyes open on the way home. A spotted woodpecker was sitting on a tv aerial pecking away at it. Apoa saw it the next day so it obviously spent a few days there expressing itself.</p>

<h3 id="a013998">linguists still love jamie</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Naked-Chef-Jamie-Oliver/dp/0140277811/"><img alt="jamienaked1wee.jpg" src="http://blogs.mtengine.com/billy/images/jamienaked1wee.jpg" width="155" height="199" /></a></p>

<p>All the linguists I spoke to were early adopters and big fans of Jamie Oliver when he first started off as a young lad zipping around London on his scooter picking up ingredients and drumming with his mates. He's still got the ability to come up with recipes that look simple, turn out to actually be simple and taste good when you've made them. We've just started a routine where the kids cook one evening meal each every week and Apoa is starting off by referring to the first <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Naked-Chef-Jamie-Oliver/dp/0140277811/">Naked Chef book</a></p>

<p>Last night we had her own adaptation of <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_12643,00.html">'Pappardelle with mixed wild mushrooms'</a> It was, indeed, delicious.</p>

<p>We're impressed by her creative and artistic approach. Her first thought was to ask us if we could pick up any enoki mushrooms and she's had us out sourcing ingredients for the past few days.</p>

<h3 id="a013870">not dry</h3>

<p>The party was great. Not dry at all. The wine was consumed rather slowly, but that may have been partly to do with the fact that there had been some consumption in advance. Nice to see  students outside class and with no more coursework or anything hanging over them (in most cases). And to hear about plans for the soon-to-be-graduating and the views from the end of year 1 and year 2.</p>

<p>It's the final deadline day of the semester so I'm sitting here typing this above a hall full of administrators gathering work from tired students. The union bar is closed until September so the only way the students can get a drink after handing in is if they come to our unbelievably hip and groovy 'handing in party'. I don't think the students know there will be alcohol available as I just heard one of them say it would be 'well dry'...</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.parkland-walk.org.uk/">Parkland Walk</a> is one of the best things about the bit of Norf London I live in. <a href="http://www.parkland-walk.org.uk/">The Friends of the Parkland Walk</a> have just reawoken themselves and I've been co-opted as a committee member to represent our local <a href="http://www.woodcraft.org.uk">Woodcraft Folk</a>. Our main activity now is to respond to the 'Greenway' proposal to improve the walk with 400 thousand pounds the council have scored from TfL after putting in a bid no-one locally was consulted on until now. I went to a packed local area assembly last night where the consultation process began to get into gear. As Jed leaves local government (his time as a councillor has just ended) I find myself beginning to go to council meetings. And as Tony Bliar gets ready to leave, I think I agree with Jed that one of his main legacies is that no-one believes in consultation any more. I'm sure 'so-called' is one of its main collocates now.</p>

<h3 id="a013729">recycling</h3>

<p>A while ago, we started a battery box at the kids' primary school (now their ex-school, sadly). The council had no battery recycling at the time. The idea was that a parent would take them to the nearest recycling point (in Barnet) when the box was full. The kids got quite motivated, writing to the council. the queen, parents, tony blair and others about it. I just had this update (the dots indicate bowdlerisation). I love the idea of sending the crisp bags back to Walker's</p>

<p>B-))</p>

<blockquote>Hi Billy,

<p>How is it going?<br />
Guess what, not only the battery box ... is still going, the children are still involved in the aftermath. The kids are now in Year 6, and last month, as a result of a letter they wrote to the Environmental Minister, they were invited to meet Ben Bradshaw and ask him some questions. The Minister was a bit of a disappointment for the children - one of them said to me "How come he is the Environmental Minister and we children know more about batteries than he does?", but I assume in time they might realize that this was their first taster of what government is sadly often all about</p>

<p>The positive side - ... the teacher who accompanied the children on<br />
the trip and who taught them in Year 5, was telling me how this whole class as a result of the battery project has turned out to be very environmentally aware, not just the kids from potentially "green backgrounds", but all of them, also the ones you wouldn't expect to be.</p>

<p>Also - as a result of the trip some of the kids had a new idea - they are collecting Walkers crisps bags, which apparently are not recyclable, and want to send them back to the company.</p>

<p>And I unintentionally came home with some new ideas and inspiration. In the current Year 4 I am going to run a plastic bag project, and ...</p>

<p>... building upon our original idea for the battery project to expand we want to try to run the battery project at other primary schools. Some of my friend have long been interested for their kids' schools. So my friend Judith and I, whose kids are at ..., want to hopefully run it at ...her... Primary School in a few weeks (Judith has started negotiating with the Head there), and hopefully later on through another friend we might be able to run it at ...another school... in Islington.</p>

<p>I have written a summary of the battery project ... to have something on paper for the ... Head to start out with.  ... Any ideas warmly welcome, please feel free to criticise and improve!</p>

Thanks a lot, and all the best<br />
Cathrin<br />

<h3 id="a013688">'late pronation'</h3>

<p>Sorry if you're squeamish but I've been back to the physio this morning and finding out a bit more about the roots of my biomechanical failure. It seems I've got late pronation and a problem with my tibialis posterior which is leading to a bit of tendonopathy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, yesterday's dentist visit revealed I'm at risk of 'cracked tooth syndrome' and the dreaded 'RCT' (root canal treatment).</p>

<p>I still have a way to go before I catch up with <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1944627,00.html">James Fenton</a>, though. He's on grade five which is when everyone says it all begins to get much more interesting.</p>

<h3 id="a013207">a tale of two saunas</h3>

<p>It's a busy summer. Last week I was at a conference in Finland having a sauna in the woods and diving into a beautiful lake as the sun went down. This week I'm in a field in Kent with a few thousand young people from all over the world who have gathered together to change it. There is a home-made sauna here, built by some of the Finnish delegation. I haven't checked it out yet but hope to in the next day or two.</p>

<p>I started the camp as coordinator for a village containing 120 people, half from Norf London and half from Bad Doberan in Germany. Today, though, we had 'Governance Day' and after some discussion about how the camp is being run (apparently, I'm 'not controlling enough' which I kind of think of as a good thing) I have been deposed and two younger people are in charge. I could think about mounting a coup but instead I've sneaked off for a bit of blogging. I'll update you later but we are currently leaderless. The German leader lost interest straight away and the English leader made a few decisions (adults do all cooking tonight and get to bed by 10.30 - don't tell her we're all very keen on this) then proposed an anarchic system with no central authority (I don't think this sounds too different from my regime) and now says she wants to stand down. She hasn't found a replacement yet, though. She asked Val whose response was as direct as ever: 'Wouldn't touch it with a bargepole mate!'</p>

<h3 id="a012781">le miserable</h3>

<p>Well, I enjoyed the pre-match atmosphere round Highbury yesterday afternoon. 4 hours before kickoff, there were hundreds of Arsenal shirts heading through the 'tickets only -sold out' signs on the doors of the pubs, 'tired and emotional' youths were making noise on Upper Street, and cars with flags were tooting at them as they went by. I was dropping off Ohna's computer which those nice Apple people have agreed to fix despite it being past its warranty (actually past its 'repair extension programme' but anyway). I stopped for a coffee and came out to find my bike had been driven into (handlebars bent, pedal on floor, crank broken, back derailleur bent). I'd been sitting ten yards away but facing in the wrong direction. Just got the call to confirm that it's 'beyond economical repair'. Time to shop around and get into debt again...</p>

<h3 id="a012753">Warning: meltdown imminent</h3>

<p>Just received this from the Guardian:</p>

<blockquote>
Welcome to Higher Noon, academic news and opinion, twice weekly from EducationGuardian.co.uk

<p>Warning: meltdown imminent</p>

<p>11 May 2006</p>

<p>Latest</p>

<p>Universities face meltdown over pay, says lecturers' leader</p>

<p>Universities face complete "meltdown" if the lecturers' pay dispute is not resolved this week, the Association of University Teachers warned employers today.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It does look like we might be in for a bumpy ride. I'm still surprised how few people know about this. I'm still trasumatising students who are about to hand in their work and haven't heard about it yet. A common response when I explain the action is, 'What, again?!' It seems many of them thought the strike was one day of action and that was that.</p>

<p>I do hope it's resolved soon, though.</p>

<h3 id="a012740">rural london</h3>

<p>Sitting in the park listening to jazz wafting as I work and surrounded by birdsong. Stood 20 yards from a wet and shaggy heron on  the way in, then said hello to a man who was walking a very large pony on the patch of grass near Bounds Green Road. Gotta love the rural life.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the lesser spotted thief has been having a go at my bank account. Seems I got 'skimmed' at the weekend.</p>

<h3 id="a012681">'practical alien linguistics could be pretty essential soon'</h3>

<p>Yes, <a href="http://www.sfwa.org/members/elgin/">Suzette Haden Elgin</a> has finally inspired me to read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575016876/">The Embedding</a> by <a href="http://www.ianwatson.info/">Ian Watson</a>. It's a linguisticsy science fiction novel in which self-embedding sentences** play an important role. The article in which she mentions it is 'Waterships All The Way Down' in Rebecca Wheeler's <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0275960552/">'Language Alive in the Classroom'</a> where she passes on some suggestions for using science fiction to teach linguistics.</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p>**like 'fish cats dogs chase eat swim fast' (which means 'fish that get eaten by cats that get chased by dogs swim fast'), or, to take a comprehensible one, 'the game those boys I met invented resembles chess' (as mentioned in Neil Smith's 1989 book 'The Twitter Machine')</p>

<h3 id="a012680">sharing in the library</h3>

<p>Wow, we're up to at least 25 <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00064OOOI/">cafe del mar</a> compilations now. I know this because I'm listening to music from Saira's computer while working in the library on the handout for a seminar next week. Sharing is great, but I need to get more stuff on this computer so I don't feel so guilty about having so little to bring to the party. It's also interesting to notice how similar all of our tastes are. Are there any academics who don't like Air?</p>

<h3 id="a012523">strike</h3>

<p>I'm on <a href="http://www.natfhe.org.uk/?id=hepay200607">strike</a> next Tuesday. Luckily, a student mentioned it in a tutorial. I hadn't had time yet to read the emails from <span class="caps">NATFHE, </span>one of which had the info. It would be typical of an academic not to know he was on strike because he hadn't read the email yet. I wouldn't faint if I found out that more than one academic uses the day to catch up on some work.</p>

<p>One depressing aspect of this is how little anyone seems to care when academics go on strike. How many of you know about the long-running <a href="http://www.natfhe.org.uk/?id=lonmetun">dispute</a> and academic boycott of London Met, for example?</p>

<p>There has been some national coverage of the coming strike and assessment boycott on the <span class="caps">BBC </span>and national papers, but it seems indicative to me that the first info on media coverage on the website is that 'news of balloting appeared in the Belfast Newsletter, Portsmouth News and elsewhere'</p>

<h3 id="a012490">mr. semantics</h3>

<p>Ohna has often commented on the irony of a useless communicator like me making a living out of studying communication. I've always thought, though, that it might be what you'd expect. Sometimes you get interested in things when they go wrong.</p>

<p>The latest example is now on my head. The barber thought the missing constituent in my explicature was 'all over my head including the top' when I thought he'd realise I meant 'just the back and sides'. I realised his mistake after he had dragged the mower right over the top of my head.</p>

<h3 id="a012396">sleeper train</h3>

<p>Had a weekend in Scotland last weekend. Mike and I went up by sleeper for Elma's 60th. A nice journey, although the plunge into darkness and silence when the engine failed at Watford was a bit weird. We arrived 4 and a half hours late, which is pretty significant when you've only got two days. It was a nice visit and good to see everybody. Kyle is at the one-word stage and has some nice versions of names. Kirstin is 'tin' and Kyle is 'me'. Kirstin is a laugh a minute and I was pleased to see her adopting 'Uncle Pongo' as a name for Mike.</p>

<p>I'd post a Scottish photo but blueyonder is letting me down again.</p>

<h3 id="a012260">back to work</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ohna/sets/1733307/"><img alt="ny0506roof.jpg" src="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/billy/images/ny0506roof.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>

<p>There were a few funny tummies at Christmas, as well as a broken boiler (which chose christmas eve to pack in) and Hogmanay was also a bit sick. Donal had mumps so his 18th birthday party/hogmanay combo was cancelled and replaced with a small neighbours' party. Andrew caught it (them?) too and we had a rather strange evening with people disappearing for lie-downs and to pop into other parties before we all got onto the bathroom roof to watch the fireworks and toast the new year. We had a quick game of Buzz (playstation music quiz) after which Ohna suggested that reducing Dad's Competivitiveness might be a resolution to go alongside my main one about improving my contribution to the quality of family life.</p>

<p>The last couple of days have been really nice with all of us at home and no school or anything. It's ending soon, though. Apoa's back to school today. We weren't sure whether she'd be able to get up after having adjusted to late mornings and nights, so we were amazed to hear her up making breakfast an hour early at 5.30. She then went back to bed and was pretty tired by the time she caught her train. I'm back to work today but working at home before getting back on campus tomorrow. We've pencilled in a break later on to start taking down decorations and the tree. Kiloh's back on Thursday so she's <span class="caps">PS2</span>ing like crazy in the meantime.</p>

<h3 id="a012215">two films and an apocalypse</h3>

<p>I would've sent this post at the weekend but you know.</p>

<p>We went to see the original King Kong at the <span class="caps">NFT </span>on Saturday afternoon. I had forgotten that it was the best film ever made. Kiloh gave me a hard time for saying so (this was an allusion to Mark Kermode - I'll tell you later). We then watched Four Weddings and a Funeral when we got home. I'm a big Mike Newell fan so I was delighted that the kids had insisted we rent it. Big excitement when we got to the scene at the <span class="caps">NFT </span>and then on the river at the South Bank. I've got a theory that the most obvious skills of Mike Newell as a director and of Hugh Grant as an actor are the same thing really, being all about timing, which is about judging what your audience needs to have happen when. Also one of the main things you need to get right in teaching.</p>

<p>Clemmie came out with us on Sunday, but the poor wee thing was suffering from a bit of a cold. Nicki came and rescued her at the end of the day.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what to make of the symbolism as I went out on Sunday to buy our Christmas tree under the almighty black cloud that was spreading over us from Hemel Hempstead.</p>

<p>Had a great time last night with <a href="http://www.robbiebushe.co.uk/">Robbie</a> and <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com">Dug</a> at the <a href="http://www.jmlondon.com/">John Martin Gallery</a></p>

<p>Robbie had four wee pictures in the show, which was <a href="http://www.jmlondon.com/pages/event/271.html">Into The Jungle - a homage to Rousseau</a></p>

<p>It was a nice show with some great work, a good mix of styles, not too many people (you could move around), men in gorilla suits, African drummers, classy cocktails and nibbles. And one of Robbie's pictures sold while we were there.</p>

<p>The audience were appropriately beautiful and stylish, and they coped well with having three big scruffy blokes galumphing through the middle of them. I've made a note to get a gorilla suit before we go to see King Kong.</p>

<p>Big problems with the servers at work. Email has been broken since Monday and they're now saying it might be the end of the week before it's working again. If anyone needs to contact me, best to use one of my other email addresses, e.g. billyclarkie a la mac dot com or billyclarkie a la gmail dot com</p>

<p>David Ewalt is doing a great job of publicising the excellent resources on language and communication at <a href="http://www.forbes.com/home/communicating/2005/10/18/communication-networks-language-cx_mn_de_comm05land.html">Forbes</a></p>

<p>I finally got round to posting about it on London Language today and found <a href="http://maizaki.blogspot.com">Mai</a> had beaten me to it. I then discovered that the language nerds of the world are all linking to it.</p>

<p>One Forbers linker is <a href="http://languagelegend.blogspot.com/">The Language Legend</a> This is an excellent resource mainly aimed at A Level English language students. I was shocked on Wednesday to discover that I had just met e-julie, the person responsible for it, but not realised that that's who she was. Could be a useful example for the sense-reference distinction (will make a nice change from Venus, the morning star and Ortcutt).</p>

<h3 id="a011870">OK with my decay</h3>

<p>45 today and Grandaddy shuffled into my ears with this incredibly appropriate song:</p>

<p><q>I'm OK/With my decay/I have no choice/I have no voice/I have no say/In my decay/I have no choice/so I'll rejoice/</q></p>

<p>Ohna Apoa and Kiloh gave me an incredibly appropriate gift of a turntable so I can finally play all my 45s. Naturally, I'm hoping to get through 45 of them. I started by taking myself back once more to the 1980s in the Neill Lounge/Aitken Disco where Musical Youth were passing the dutchie to the totally wired fall and <a href="http://www.robbiebushe.co.uk">Robbie </a> was breaking the <span class="caps">DJ'</span>s lights dancing to Depeche Mode. Then I decided to let Kiloh break things up a bit with a choice of her own. She went straight for The American by Simple Minds leaving me straight back in the 80s and visions of young men in big coats.</p>

<p>I'll carry on my celebrations now by reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140291237/">Steven Pinker </a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199264376/">Ray Jackendoff</a> to prepare for class this afternoon.</p>

<p>On my way to the tube station last night I was asked to stop by four young women who looked to be around 14 or so. They asked me for 50p 'congestion charge'. One of them put her hands on the front of my bike and tried to stop me carrying on. Blinking flip!</p>

<h3 id="a011745">moving in</h3>

<p>Remembered to time myself cycling to the new campus this morning. 45 minutes from when I started cycling at home to arriving at the bike rack here.</p>

<p>I've now got everything into our office (but not at all organised) apart from five crates of books. Sylvia has 6 more crates. We have no more room, though. An interesting little puzzle. I've got no idea what will happen when students come to discuss things (something I spend a lot of time doing).</p>

<p>No individual post trays yet so I went to the mail room, gathered all of our mail into a big sack and carried it fatherchristmaslike to the building where I sorted and distributed it. Several colleagues asked me whether I was being 'redeployed'</p>

<p>Well, I'm fully back to Trent Park now and struggling to combine catching up with doing new things and unpacking. We have a desperate need of shelving which is currently being thwarted by the system.</p>

<p>It's nice to be here, though, and getting used to a new (and longer) cycle route. Really nice to cycle through the foggy woods yesterday morning, including a tumble when the bike jammed in the mud. Left my knee slightly iffy so today was a public transport day. Always an adventure.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how much I'm going to enjoy the extra time involved in cycling home every evening. This was added to yesterday by having to visit the police station on the way home to report Apoa's passport having been lost on the music trip to Paris at the weekend. A bit of a surreal experience as they constantly impress on you the importance of reporting it quickly and then make it very hard. I particularly enjoyed the policeman's first response at the station which was that Apoa would have to come in herself to prove that I wasn't 'making her up'. Luckily, he decided it would be OK seeing as she's only 12.</p>

<h3 id="a011698">starting up again</h3>

<p>I've had a few real 3-D people comment on the lack of posts now so I guess it's time to get going again. I expect I'll post more after Monday when I'll be spending more time sitting among the unpacked crates in my new office.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I'm at a conference trying to understand the apparent lack of recursion in Piraha syntax despite its obvious presence in the semantics of their utterances and thoughts, and keeping up with family life by email. Here's part of an update from Ohna on Apoa's first day back at school:</p>

<p><q>First day of school this morning was very typical. I asked her to make sure she had all her things packed last night, but of course as she was about to leave, she realised she didn't have her travel pass sorted, or her mobile phone or any money &amp; I forgot to make her a packed lunch!!</q></p>

<h3 id="a009524">shooting</h3>

<p>I've been amazed at how cool the kids I've spoken to have been about the bombs and everything. Apoa was genuinely shocked today, though, when she heard about police shooting someone on the tube. She acted like she couldn't believe it. 'But that's the death penalty!' she said. She couldn't believe the police would administer justice on the spot. I pointed out that we don't know what was happening yet and we had a discussion about the law on self-defence and stuff as well. There's a <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/news/archives/2005/07/22/man_shot_at_london_tube_station.html">discussion</a> of this going at the Guardian's <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/news/">newsblog</a> just now.</p>

<p>I have no time to blog at the moment as I'm trying to get my stuff out of my office before they move everything to the new campus and get everything sorted before we go camping tomorrow. Hoping to catch a glimpse of Ohna overnight on the way. Wish I had time to tell you about the conference I just got back from. Some other time.</p>

<h3 id="a009509">restless night</h3>

<p>Took Apoa through to my bed when I got home last night. She's off school again today. Kiloh came through at 4.30 saying she'd heard plates smashing and the dog barking next door. After some discussion we decided it was probably not what she thought and that it wasn't worth calling in the middle of the night to check. At 7.30 Andrew phoned from Ireland to ask me to check on Donal who said he'd phone when he got home last night but hadn't phoned. I went round to find the house very quiet apart from a not-tuned-in radio playing upstairs. Donal was bleary but fine.</p>

<p>I encouraged Kiloh to keep her ears open. She has scared off burglars from their garden in the past.</p>

<p>Well, the groovy new phone is going back to the shop tomorrow and they're bringing me a new one. Still, I've already had a fair amount of photo fun (helped by both girls being off school today) and spent around a day working out how to do things and getting my old contacts onto the new phone. Now I'm about to spend half a day getting them back again. B-)</p>

<p>And Robbie and I have exchanged photos between here and Cyprus. I'm glad to see <a href="http://www.robbiebushe.co.uk">Robbie</a> is blogging again. Got to work out that Cyprus/Hastings lifeshare for him.</p>

<h3 id="a009498">mobile life</h3>

<p>[PICTURE <span class="caps">REMOVED</span> AT <span class="caps">REQUEST</span> OF <span class="caps">SUBJECT</span>]</p>

<p>Had a nice day at Alice and Justin's picnic on Sunday. Played a couple of hours of football until Tim ruined it by pointing out that grown-ups were taking a game against five-year-olds a little too seriously. <a href="http://maizaki.blogspot.com">Mai</a> came with some friends and a birthday cake. Nicki came with Clemmie and they came home for tea and a bit of a play afterwards. And a Lancaster Bomber, a spitfire and a hurricane flew over fresh from dropping poppies on the mall.</p>

<p>This was likely to be the last we see of Ohna for a few weeks as she gets back from Milan just after we all leave for summer camp and we all get back from that just after she goes to New York B-(</p>

<p>After years of being the one with the ancient bashed-up phone, I leapt to the other extreme the other day and got a phone that does all those groovy things like taking photos, browsing the web, bluetooth, etc. My favourite feature is the radio as I won't have to think about packing one now. I hoped to be able to send Ohna some photos while she's away but phone and blackberry technology has been defeating us so <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> should do the job. This is the first pic I took.</p>

<h3 id="a009456">cooking on wood</h3>

<p>Looks like I might be going on summer camp with the woodcraft folk again this year. I particularly enjoyed this bit of the information letter which I'm still trying to understand:</p>

<p><q>We understand that some people are concerned about the toilet arrangements. We will put up a shower tent and we might even get our 'solar water heater' working for it. For lavatories we shall get the farmer to dig a slit trench. The alternative would be to use chemical lats but over many years we have found that using slit trenches is more hygienic and pleasanter. If you have never used them it may sound unlikely, but let us assure you it's true. It's like cooking on wood being more efficient than cooking on gas. Certainly we hope that it won't put people off.</q></p>

<h3 id="a009455">illness predicted 22.6.05</h3>

<p>Academics often get ill on the first day after term ends. The theory is that you keep yourself at full throttle as long as term's on and then something subconscious allows the illness to kick in as soon as you don't have a class/meeting/deadline for tomorrow. Some academics think it's a good idea to catch a cold a week or two before the end of term just to avoid being in bed for the first week of the break.</p>

<p>Another generalisation about academia is that workloads shoot up at the end of summer teaching as marking coincides with all those meetings that couldn't be scheduled in teaching time and with all those deadlines that got pushed back during the term. This year it's been madder than ever for me, which you'll already know if you've noticed the gap on the blog.</p>

<p>For several weeks now, I've had 22nd June pencilled in as the day when things will get a bit more manageable. So we'll see whether illness awaits (and yes, I do already have two meetings booked in for that day).</p>

<p>Anyway, I think I'm going to sneak the odd minute for a bit of blogging again now. This one is being posted between phone calls on a day of interviewing for a position that attracted such an international set of applicants that we're only seeing two of them in person.</p>

<h2>May 10, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009432">music and adventure</h3>

<p>Went to Apoa's music concert after work today and this is me just getting back from it at 11.30pm. Apoa and Kiloh got a lift home and arrived around 9.30ish.</p>

<p>All I can say is that I really appreciate a head teacher who thinks he's leaving a governors' meeting at 10.30pm and is heading off home, only to be met by a biker who's been waiting to explain that his bike is locked in the pupils' bike shed and that the caretaker hasn't got a key, and who still smilingly sorts everything out and sympathises with me for having had to wait so long. I even more appreciate a deputy head who gets out of bed to answer his answer machine and explain where the key is.</p>

<p>The concert was great, with a mix of styles and abilities. Some of the kids were amazingly good. The crowd's favourite was a violin soloist who performed a very complicated piece with no music and then had to return for a second bow. I particularly enjoyed Jessie's trombone version of 'Summertime' which hypnotised the whole room. I thought we were about to be sucked into the end of the trombone. There were also two memorable versions of the Titanic theme, one haunting voice (three vocalists) and piano version in the first half and later a completely different take in which Apoa and some classmates had worked out their own arrangement for two pianists, a bass guitar, flute, clarinet and oboe.</p>

<p>Deadline day is Monday which means I'm being swamped with last-minute drafts, so I spent my waiting time reading about things like case theory and the dative alternation.</p>

<p>Apoa's tube pass ran out today so I had the added pleasure of a visit to the tube station to renew it on the way home, and a cycle down the <span class="caps">A10 </span>on the way - not recommended around 11pm, I'd say.</p>

<h3 id="a009430">quizzing</h3>

<p>I was feeling cocky after getting both of the mystery guests on Question of Sport on Friday, so imagine my surprise when I settled down to watch the final of University Challenge only to find that I could hardly process any of the questions, let alone answer them. I know I used to know some answers back in the old days! I didn't even get all of the linguistics questions! For the record, I got 'synthetic', 'agglutinative', 'Noam Chomsky' and 'article', but 'Mandarin' foxed me.</p>

<h2>May  6, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009422">election post mortem</h3>

<p>Well, Barbara Roche lost. I think it's a shame as she was a good local MP and worked really hard for her constituents. Here are some thoughts from a local Labour Party worker:</p>

<p><q>Iraq (and Blair more generally) were massive issues over on the western side of the constituency and cost us loads of votes. But genuinely it was hardly mentioned over in Wood Green (except approvingly as evidence of Blair's courage and leadership, but then only by Asian and Middle Eastern voters). There the determinants were apathy and possibly immigration. I was harangued at length by a Jamaican about the injustice of all the perks that the latest wave of immigrants get, while his family get nothing - I found it very hard to argue the point, although I've never had a problem doing so with white working class punters; I heard from other activists that they had experienced this same 'pulling up the ladder' phenomenon, so plainly some unlikely people were thinking what Mr Howard was thinking).</q></p>

<p><q>A little insight on apathy/tunrout for you. In Woodside (north east of Wood Green), where I spent most of yesterday, we had 40% of the vote just based on our 'promises' (supportive canvass returns); you can add at least another 20% or so to this if you factor up proportionately for those 'unknown'/uncontacted who also voted. This was not untypical, so in the Labour parts of the constituency, I think we were getting about 60% of the vote. However, turnout was barely over 40%, whereas across the whole constituency it was about 60% (so vastly higher in Muswell Hill, Highgate and Crouch End). We lost by 2500 votes. Had turnout in our 5 best wards (out of the ten in the constituency) been at the average, we probably would have won, albeit by a handful of votes. Differential turnout - it's how elections are won and lost. Still, the fact that we lost huge numbers of voters in the leafy west (but not to the Greens, whose vote and share fell) probably means we wouldn't have won anyway, so enough of the post mortem. We've got four more years to get it right and a much stronger Crouch End Labour Party, so it's not all bad.</q></p>

<h3 id="a009418">election blog: too smelly?</h3>

<p>Well, I would have liked to have had the time to pass on lots of thoughts and news about the election, but it looks like this will have to be your lot. I've been wavering like never before on this one. I can see that the Tories would be a disaster so 'hold your nose and vote Labour' seems sensible. On the other hand, the stink really is pretty bad and 'the other guys are worse' isn't much of a sales gimmick. On the other other hand, they have done some good stuff and it would be a shame if that was dumped because of their bad side. On the other other other hand, if that happens, isn't it their fault rather than ours? I mean, who is it who's been going round alienating voters? And isn't it good to send the mesasage that you can't get away with some things? I have to say that there have been more cases than usual of election messages pushing me to do the opposite of what they want me to do. The letter from our local Tory candidate began by saying what a good hard-working MP Barbara Roche is! Which she is, so that's quite a strong argument too. The most persuasive, though, was the talk of Blunkett yesterday, and, even more forceful, the talk by Blunkett (i.e. he's persuading me not to vote Labour by saying I'm a self-indulgent middle class whinger if I don't).</p>

<p>I've had a few interesting political discussions recently, including Roger suggesting that this might be 1970 over again, Ade worrying that it might be 1992, and Robert saying that it's <strong>everybody's </strong> fault if it all goes wrong. As he put it:</p>

<p><q>When we had two million on the streets we should have rioted for peace and brought down the government...</q></p>

<p>Although he did add helpfully add that:</p>

<p><q>That would not have worked either.</q></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Apoa's still quite engaged. Apparently, the Tories are the funniest in her school mock election. She can't decide whether to vote for the funny ones since it doesn't really count or go for who she might vote for in real life. Both Apoa and Kiloh are asking if they can come to see the polling booth with me tomorrow. Hope tennagerdom doesn't apatheticise them,</p>

<p>Can't believe they got to broadcast this story making an analogy between Tony Blair and evil aliens trying to destroy the planet ('aliens have incredible superweapons ... capable of deployment in 45 seconds ... weapons of mass destruction ... UN needs to grant us the power to use nukes... etc.') during the election campaign. I suppose they're counting on how stupid Tony would look if he kicked up a fuss about <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/">Dr. Who</a> ;-)</p>

<h3 id="a009404">whale's tails and princesses</h3>

<p>Today I should have helped Ohna and Apoa sort out some of the mess in the spare room and I should have helped our local Woodcraft Folk sort out the camping equipment in the store. But I've done my neck in (probably partly to do with the bus trip to Oxford yesterday) so now I'm damaging my neck doing a pile of marking and listening to itunes shuffling around. The joy of 'shuffle' is of course the stuff you forgot you had. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007IFR5/qid=1114357707/">The Cocteau Twins</a> singing Whale's Tails was the highlight so far, but they've just been topped by Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret's 'A Broadcast Message To Children' which they recorded during World War Two and you can hear on the British Library's The Century In Sound. Very spooky to suddenly hear this very posh child's voice from a whole other world.</p>

<p>I recommend the bus as a way of getting to Oxford, btw. A quick cycle down to Baker Street, the bike goes in the boot and you can fall asleep listening to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00070DK5A/qid=1114357756/">David Bowie</a> performing live and doing your neck in until you arrive, wake up and get cycling.</p>

<p>It was really nice to see Robbie and cycle round the pubs of Oxford with him. He needs to find some mates, though, and some artistic inspiration. Any friendly humans in Oxford?</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p>PS Seminar task: spot the syntactic ambiguity in this post ;-)</p>

<p>I was shocked at 1am last night to peek in on Apoa and find she was still reading three hours after we'd said good night. She's still in bed now, though, which is good. Off to Oxford to see Robbie now (I've practically finished the validation document and have at least sent on the important bits, so I can do this with a bit less guilt than I would have otherwise).</p>

<h2>April 22, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009401">a very long engagement</h3>

<p>Ages ago <a href="http://www.jobbles.demon.co.uk/">Jed</a> sent Ohna the piece on <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0344510/">A Very Long Engagement</a> from American Cinematographer. He wrote 'Go see!' at the bottom of every page.</p>

<p>After <a href="http://www.robbiebushe.co.uk/">Robbie</a> gave it the double thumbs-up ('best film I've seen in ages!') we finally managed it on Thursday. We were both tired and wanted to spend some time together so we weren't sure if a movie was the right thing, but it was great and just the right movie to see at that time - we even managed to stay awake long enough for a bite and a chat afterwards. Jeunet is very comic-booky which is only one reason why you'd expect Jed and Robbie to like the movie. The pacing was less frenetic and the storytelling a bit less gimmicky than <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0211915/">Amélie</a> but it was also a 'fabuleux destin'. This one was both a fairytale and also to do with real things (such as World War One). It was fascinating to read about it from a technical point of view (mainly Bruno Delbonnel the cinematographer's) in American Cinematographer, with details of lenses and colour mixing and testing to see which lenses would work with Audrey Tautou's face, given that Jeunet wanted lots of wide-angle close-ups with a slight tilt:</p>

<p><q>We saw that her face worked well with the 25mm and the 27mm. The 21mm still works for her, but you have to be careful; the 18mm doesn't work, nor does the 35mm.</q></p>

<p>I was particularly impressed with the 460-square-foot frame, with lights attached, that they suspended from a 70-ton crane above the trenches to block out the sun. The frame could also be tilted to change its orientation. Quite a contrast from some of Ohna's low-budget affairs, and of course totally pointless if the story's no good...</p>

<p>And then there was all the detail about the 'naked' camera with a foam cushion on the side so that offscreen actors could be really close to help the onscreen ones. And on and on... </p>

<p>Also interesting to hear him talk about how definitely he wanted it all not to be realistic ('Realism doesn't interest me! I strive for an unrealistic approach') but also didn't want the scenes in the trenches to be too beautiful to depict the horrors of war.</p>

<p>I could go on...</p>

<h2>April 15, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009381">civilisation</h3>

<p>Went to bed at around 10 o'clock last night. This is early for me. I was drained after spending the morning at a rather charged meeting and then heading straight off to Cambridge for a conference.</p>

<p>I had to miss the first day of the conference because of the meeting but I had a nice evening cycling around looking at cows and popping into an overheated internet cafe where I bumped into <a href="http://maizaki.blogspot.com/">Mai</a> who had had the same idea. I've just left the conference room because I missed the speaker's handout and he's talking too fast for me to follow it. I then asked a couple of people and discovered that they have a room here with computers just for us to use.</p>

<p>It's all very civilised here. I made a joke about auditors to an academic downstairs and he said 'what are auditors?' (Maybe only academics will know why the next sentence might begin 'Picking myself off the floor, ...'). I also enjoy all the College stuff. Having breakfast in a big dark hall (candles are the only illumination on offer) and trying to get a proper view of the portraits (some top quality stuff), and I must make sure I stay up late tonight just so I can come in the night way (through a tiny door in the back garden, into the back of a building, out the front of it, and then along the terrace to our place).</p>

<p>I'm now very excited because I've been looking at this <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1403902976">book on Grice</a> longingly since it came out, not being able to afford it and not wanting to wait until the library finally gets it, and it was on special offer here for conference attendees (half price). Now I don't know whether to wait until I've polished off <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0571225470/">The Inheritors</a> before getting into it.</p>

<p>The Inheritors is looking good, although I just started last night. Two days after Tim persuaded me I had to read it, Sylvia deposited it on the book crossing shelf outside my office. Tim is here and tells me he's also persuaded himself to reread it. We looked at in class the other day, doing a bit of Hallidayan analysis on it. It seemed appropriate, since <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=halliday+inheritors&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en">Halliday's paper</a> on it is a stylistics classic. The class was fun and, for me at least, the exercise demonstrated Hallidayan analysis, showed how it's useful for stylistics, revealed some of the style of the book, and made me want to read more.</p>

<h2>April 12, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009376">'Grandma, when is the world going to end?'</h3>

<p>This was a question Kirstin asked Elma in the car the other day. I collected a few other nice bits of linguistic data today:</p>

<p><q>Daddy, you should be finished your class by now!</q></p>

<p>(A pouty voicemail from Kiloh at 4.37pm, with a dramatic pause between each word - class finished at 5pm)</p>

<p><q><span class="caps">PAEDIATRICS </span>- Please remember gonad protection. This is a legal requirement</q></p>

<p>(Sign behind the screen when Apoa was getting her arm x-rayed. The diagrams were also cool, one with flesh and one with bones)</p>

<p>The other was Apoa's bewildered silence when the doctor asked her, 'How can I help you?' I thought it was because she was used to doctors talking to me rather than her, but she said it was because she didn't expect to be asked how the doctor could help. She says next time she'll just say, 'cream, painkillers and an x-ray please!' ;-)</p>

<p>You'll have gathered that I did have to take Apoa to the doctor and then an x-ray today. Bad choice of day. The doctor was very busy and the x-ray department was busy and had some broken machinery. The receptionist explained there'd be at least an hour of a wait and asked us to take a seat, pointing to a waiting area with no unoccupied seats. The floor was fine, though. There's no fracture so it's just a case of waiting for it to feel better. Meanwhile no PE or guitar or anything.</p>

<p>Missed my office hours this morning and ended up over half an hour late for my class (I did warn them, though). The topic today was grammar in schools so we looked at Debbie Cameron's discussion in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/041510355X/">Verbal Hygiene</a> of the conservative obsession with grammar and standards in the 1980s. So, of course, we had to talk about <a href="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/billy/2002/04/index.html">Mistress Chloe</a></p>

<h2>April  8, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009371">don't look back/forward</h3>

<p>This summer, Middlesex is closing its Tottenham campus and a load of us are moving to Trent Park, which is where I was based when I first came here. So today I left Mark fixing the flood and leak (he was there working on a bunch of things including our still malfunctioning and now electrically dangerous central heating system when a huge amount of water fell into the hall having slowly built up from a leak in a heating pipe under the landing (the water had risen to just below floorboard level before it came through)) and Apoa and Rachel on their way to the swimming pool (are your linguistic processing modules still with me?) and travelled by train and tube up to Oakwood and on to my former workplace (the bike is still in the shop after a bit of confusion about a wheel yesterday*).</p>

<p>It's weird coming back. I started by standing at the wrong place waiting for the minibus up from the tube station to the campus and since then I've been bumping into lots of people whose names I used to know and wondering whether or not to reintroduce myself. I'm sitting now in a large open-plan computer centre which includes what used to be my office and I'm also more or less underneath what will be my shared cupboard after September. Trent Park is a lovely campus in a country park that has a lot of history (George <span class="caps">III </span>used to visit here, the Sassoon family owned it at the start of the twentieth century, it was a <span class="caps">POW </span>camp for German officers during <span class="caps">WWII, </span>etc.), lovely views and great walks and cycle trails. Still, I've always liked Tottenham, which is more 'street' and has buildings named after Jimi Hendrix, Jenny Seacole and Toussaint <span class="caps">L'O</span>uverture rather than mad king's doctors (forgive the syntactic ambiguity) and things.</p>

<p>I came for an open day and spent it meeting some really nice potential students and staff (although I'm now being made nervous by the student next to me whose mouse keeps getting too close to my left hand). I particularly enjoyed chatting to my History and English colleagues about Leavis and the legendary William Empson scandal of the condoms.</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p>*I sent it in for a service and spoke repair. I'm collecting it later today with a new chain, cassette, rear wheel and saddle. The holdup was because I told the guy working on it I had a spare wheel in the shed, only to find out too late that it was a front wheel rather than a rear one. Soon my bike will be like the axe that's had its handle and blade changed several times but has been in the family for generations.</p>

<h3 id="a009367">'Labour's unthinking opposition'</h3>

<p><a title="Guardian Unlimited | Columnists | Labour's unthinking opposition" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,5673,1451278,00.html">Guardian Unlimited | Columnists | Labour's unthinking opposition</a></p>

<p>I agree with David Aaronovitch's criticism of the 'prejudice, cynicism and lack of political nous' of some people who oppose Tony Blair. It seems that humans are designed to like broad conclusions and over-strong generalisations, and to hold conclusions strongly without fully exploring all of the relevant evidence. This applies as much to academics as anyone else, even though one of the main aims of their work is to practice and teach careful analysis of arguments. (There will undoubtedly be some academics who disagree with this but, by definition, not in such a way that I could enter into an argument with them).</p>

<p>I think this will be an interesting election because the electorate is more aware than ever of things they don't like about the various voting options. I live in a fairly sheltered part of North London so I don't have much contact with the real world where there are people who are worried about immigration, who supported the war in Iraq, and even some who would ever consider voting Tory (I remember how the neighbours all pitied young Toby, the Tory candidate in our last local elections who was dutifully working the doorsteps asking everyone to confirm that they wouldn't be voting for him). The people I meet are quite unsure what to do in the election. There's definitely unhappiness with Labour, particularly to do with the war, but people don't seem too sure what they do want to do with their vote and they'd definitely hate to see the Tories get in.</p>

<p>Of course, there's also a general feeling of powerlessness associated with not being in the small group of voters who will really decide the outcome. I guess that's one thing that my world does share with the majority of the country.</p>

<p>Despite their shortcomings, I do see that Labour are far preferable to the Tories. The main thing that annoys me about them is still the war and the way they defend their decision to join in (mainly by pretending that anti-war people are pro-Saddam and anti-ever-doing-anything-about-it).</p>

<p>Locally, our MP is Barbara Roche. I know a lot of the 'literary dinner-party' people David Aaronovitch mentioned will be quite negative about her, but I do think she does a good job for people here (and not just because she has been supportive of <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org">The Lecture List</a>). We see plenty of her in school and elsewhere, and she did get the graffiti off of Andrew's wall for him.</p>

<h3 id="a009335">producers, blackberries and holding your drink</h3>

<p>It's been a busy week. Went to see The Producers with Ohna on Monday. It's not perfect, but I think you have to see it. Brad Oscar is great as Max so we didn't miss Nathan Lane. Interesting that I found the comedy gays a bit boring even though the show is nothing but tasteless jokes, with comedy nazis and comedy old ladies etc. Ohna's been given a blackberry by her work which I would think of as a disaster. Sure enough, she was being emailed in and out of the theatre. We went for a bite afterwards and she was outside on the phone when our food arrived.</p>

<p>Went to an opening with Dug and Alan last night and then Ohna joined us later. Found myself not coping too well with the alcoholic intake, so I'll try to be sensible tonight.</p>

<h3 id="a009334">if you can't lobby, go to the alley</h3>

<p>I thought I was going to lobby parliament with Kiloh and Anna Clare today. The woodcraft folk have had their government grant stopped so we were off to try to persuade some MPs to do something about it. It turned out, though, that I had got the day wrong and the lobbying was yesterday. So we took the opportunity to go bowling and now I'm using the time before meeting Rupert for a movie trip to do a bit of blogging.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://society.guardian.co.uk/children/story/0,,1439170,00.html">article by David Batty</a> says that some people think they took away the woodcraft folk's money because they were against the war. It can't have been a surprise that woodies were against the war, though. I mean, we spend a lot of our time sitting round campfires singing about things like the H-bomb's thunder and how we're going to lay down our arms and how you've got axes so we'll get axes too.... Like, woodcraft folk are against war, full stop. Anyway, hope they see sense. Kiloh and Anna reckon they might, seeing as how the election is coming up. I kind of think, though, that we've got another goverment who would put me in the category of 'wouldn't vote for us anyway'.</p>

<h2>March 18, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009329">flu</h3>

<p>Well, the reason I've been quiet for a bit is cos I got a kind of flu-like thing last week (10 days ago) and after I got better I had a load of stuff to catch up on. I'm just about back up to speed now, although that partly depends on a few things getting done this weekend. I examined a PhD last Friday when I was just about recovered, which was fun despite my slightly less than 100% state. Since then I've been mainly catching up. Middlesex has carried on with its amazing range of speakers. I went to see David Putnam the other day giving a really good talk on how he moved from film to education. The main idea was that film can be a really important thing if it has to do with our common humanity and collective responsibility. He's fed up with films where bombs only land on just the right people and murders leave no widows. So maybe he was in education even when he was in film? I also made it to the session with Guy Jenkin, who wrote loads of TV comedy including some Spitting Image and Drop The Dead Donkey (I always thought that was a great title and a not quite so great show) and Graham Lineham who wrote Father Ted among other stuff (of course a great show but I've always had a bit of a problem with priests - not that I particularly know any or anything). I would have maybe seen Howard Brenton but he cancelled at the last minute, and I definitely would have seen Michael Rosen (on 'Are books for children worth reading?') if the subject review I was involved in hadn't taken 10 hours (from 9.15am until 7.15pm). This was in Middlesex's country park campus where I used to be based and will be again after summer. Funny to be moving back and it feels longer ago than I'd realised. I'll miss Tottenham but I'm looking forward to being back to the countryside. This week I also managed to miss Kiloh's appearance for the school team in the girls' football finals. I felt less bad, though, when I heard she didn't get to play. She's usually one of the subs but they didn't use any subs in any of their games, which was sad for the four kids who didn't get a game. I was pleased to hear that Kiloh took this really well and said it was the team that mattered. Or is she a bad player if she hasn't learned to get on the moby to her agent as soon as anything like this happens?</p>

<h3 id="a009320">happy birthday apoa</h3>

<p>Apoa woke up at 3.30 and at 3.45 but then managed to sleep until 6. She enjoyed opening cards and pressies in our bed and then had a nice breakfast (brownie and milk - putting aside her anti-exczema dairy freeness for one day) but is particularly pleased that it's snowing properly on her birthday.</p>

<p>We finally gave in and bought her a mobile phone. We used to say she could get one when she could afford to buy one and pay for her own calls, but a train plus bus journey every day persuaded us it would be practical if she had one. We made sure the phone came with everything to get started but of course it came without a battery, so I'm off to Woolies this afternoon.</p>

<p>My bike has been in Crouch End for a couple of days now, following the double puncture on Wednesday (that's 6 in the past month) and I don't like cycling when there are icy roads, so I took the bus which was pleasant. Particularly enjoyed being reminded how ahead of their time Cabaret Voltaire were from the <a href="http://www.mojo4music.com/">Mojo</a> Beyond Punk compiliation, and everyone on the bus enjoyed the bus behind driving into us (slowly) at a bus stop on the way.</p>

<h3 id="a009316">stroud green: a 'dormitory community?'</h3>

<p><a title="The Independent Online Edition - Money" href="http://money.independent.co.uk/property/homes/story.jsp?story=613665">The Independent Online Edition - Money</a></p>

<p>Seems our neighbourhood is 'losing its anonymity'. Naturally, there are a few things us locals wouldn't agree with in this article but it'll be interesting to see if people will begin to have heard of Stroud Green. At the moment I always tell people I live in Finsbury park so that they don't have to ask where Stroud Green is. Crouch End is definitely a bit more heard-of these days, although it was news to me until some of our friends moved there.</p>

<p>When we moved here, Mrs Stefanou told us this was 'one of the nicest bits of Crouch End' while her son told us it was a great place to be because it was 'so easy to get to Crouch End from here'.</p>

<h3 id="a009314">me cyaan believe it</h3>

<p>Got up this morning, went past the post office to collect a package containing Apoa's birthday presents from Jed and Ruth, took the parcels out of the box so I could fit them in the bike bag, headed off to Middlesex for a morning of equal opportunities training (more linguistic data than you could shake a stick at (whatever that means)) bought a sandwich and ate half of it before my first tutee arrived at 1.15, then finished it at 5 after the last one left, then went to hear <a href="http://lister.ultrakohl.com/Homepage/LKJ/lkj.htm">Linton Kwesi Johnson</a> talk about <a href="http://www.courses.vcu.edu/ENG-snh/Caribbean/Barbados/Poetry/smith.htm">Michael Smith</a> before (now) heading off for a night out with Ohna. Somehow managed to read the start of an MA dissertation and approve three more encyclopedia articles inbetween, which means I'm only waiting for two and then my only remaining job will be to look at the proofs and corrections suggested by authors (hooray). A busy day, but I enjoyed it. Linton Kwesi Johnson is a visiting professor here which is very cool. I pretended to be John Peel, though, and suppressed my starstruckness.</p>

<h3 id="a009306">good grief!</h3>

<p>I might have mentioned that I'm writing encyclopedia articles just now as well as editing a section in the encyclopedia. There are just a few articles I'm responsible for that still need a bit of revising, but theoretically I have 6 more to write myself by Monday. Before I left last night I went over one of them changing some things, including stuff I was sure I'd already changed. Sure enough, I just found a version of the paper that already had some of the changes in it. Which means that where I am now is more or less where I had already got to a couple of weeks ago. Grrr! The reassuring thing is that a lot of the changes I made yesterday are more or less the same as the ones I'd made before.</p>

<h3 id="a009289">this charming man</h3>

<p>Sitting up late reviewing encyclopedia entries. Thank you <a href="http://www.nme.com"><span class="caps">NME</span></a> and <a href="http://www.channel4.com">Channel 4</a> for putting on the <a href="http://www.nmeawards.com/"><span class="caps">NME</span> Awards</a> shows to keep me entertained. I love hearing musos chat about each other and particularly enjoyed them talking about The Libertines with Pete Doherty being a member of the panel. He really is a charming bugger, isn't he?</p>

<p>I also still get a buzz from emailing an author in the states and getting an instant response at 2 in the morning. I remember when email was new and this was a truly amazing thing. Yes, that's right, I remember when we used the post, sending my first ever article off to a US journal and having to wait for comments to come back in the mail. On bits of paper!</p>

<h3 id="a009284">apple pie and memories</h3>

<p>Had a really nice trip to Auntie Lorna's with Bessie and Ted today. Was surprised to see how much at home I felt in Inverurie with the shops full of lunch hour kids, having been one of those kids for just a couple of years many moons ago. Lorna served up a lovely meal of soup and apple pie and then we enjoyed a healthy helping of photographs and memories. In these days of deferred parenting, I think Lorna deserves some kind of medal for having great-great-grandchildren (she can gather five generations of Mitchells together in one place). Bessie offered a couple of good linguistic examples:</p>

<p>- Lewis calls his grandad 'dyde' as the Belger word for grandad is 'dydie'</p>

<p>- Philip used to call his great grandma his 'afa-grandma' ('afa'='awful')</p>

<p>Followed this nostalgia-fest with a nice evening with Kim in the swinging hotspots of the Broch.</p>

<h2>February 10, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009281">notes from the belger</h3>

<p>I just made the radical move of taking a few days' leave during term-time to come and make a long overdue visit to Bessie and Ted in Cairnbulg (or the 'Belger' as the locals call it). Had a nice flight up and then annoyed the locals with my slow driving on the way out (I'm not an eagle at the best of times but I'm Mr. Magoo when driving at night). I felt sensible, though, when I heard about the latest horrible death on the Aberdeen-Fraserburgh road last week.</p>

<p>Bessie and Ted are in bed now so I'm sitting in the kitchen trying to catch up with encyclopedia reviewing in the hope that I'll also find some time to finish my own articles in the next few days. It's quite nice sitting in a quiet kitchen with a newly-double-framed Apoa and Kiloh watching over me while I work. Compensates a bit for missing Apoa's dramatic performance at school tonight (that's literal, as in acting in a play ;-)</p>

<p>I also enjoyed discovering Newsnight Scotland where the debate was about which kind of alternative the Scottish Socialist Party should be offering and how left wing it should be. A nice change from the election debate in England which, as <a href="http://comment.independent.co.uk/columnists_a_l/johann_hari/story.jsp?story=609182">Johann Hari</a> put it, is all about whether Blair or Howard can seem the most rabidly right wing.</p>

<p>I'd have quoted Johann Hari's piece directly but, despite having paid 60p to read the print version earlier today, it costs another quid to read it on the web. I decided to go for it and went through some form-filling which included a question where you tick to receive spam followed instantly by a question where you tick not to receive spam (BT Click&amp;Buy are the ********s who are responsible for this) but then they deactivated my account with no explanation at the end of the process B-}</p>

<p>It was interesting to read Johann Hari's piece straight after reading George Orwell on the rampant spread of socialism around the world in 1948 earlier today.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.orwelltoday.com/senatehouse.shtml"><img height="250" width="146" alt="senatehouse2.jpg" src="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/billy/senatehouse2.jpg" width="452" height="640" /></a></p>

<p>Spent most of yesterday in <a href="http://www.orwelltoday.com/senatehouse.shtml">Senate House</a>, a beautiful building that was used as the Ministry of Information during World War II and which was the model for George Orwell's Ministry of Truth. Funnily enough, Keith didn't know that when he referred to 'Room 101' during one of our meetings. When I met him earlier he said 'this is Richard the Third'. It took me a while to realise he was referring to the <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0114279/">movie with Ian McKellen</a> set in a fascist 1930's England. Also funnily enough, I'm currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1843543265/qid=1107514130/">Orwell - The Observer Years</a>. He's such a good writer, but it's also fascinating to read his reports about what was happening 'on the ground' in Paris and Germany at the end of the war.</p>

<p>I followed two meetings of academics in Senate House with yet another meeting with Griselda, working on getting a partner/'angel' sorted for <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org">The Lecture List</a>, which is doing great but really needs to find a partner now. (Any offers?)</p>

<p>I then fitted in a quick bit of work in Borders (just managing on the way to pick up a double bass book for Kiloh from a nice man in Denmark Street who was trying to lock up but took the trouble to get me the book before he did) and then I went to meet Ohna who had spent the day waiting for a meeting that still hasn't happened.</p>

<p>We thought we must have good karma when we managed to get the lucky window seat in the Dog and Duck, but this morning began with tax disasters and now my bike has a puncture and a broken rack.</p>

<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>that should keep you going. Back to work.</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p>PS Please, someone, find a home for <a href="http://www.robbiebushe.co.uk">Robbie</a> in Oxford. I can't bear what that bus trip is doing to him.</p>

<h3 id="a009266">sign language</h3>

<p>Had a good session at woodcraft on <a href="http://www.british-sign.co.uk/">British Sign Language</a></p>

<p>I can now sign the alphabet, ask for chocolate, tell you my name and ask you yours, ask if you want help and apologise for not being a signer.</p>

<p>I think the grownups' favourite sign was the one where you turn a key in your neck to tell people to turn their voices off.</p>

<h3 id="a009258">i'm a liar</h3>

<p>Apoa just came in and objected that I hadn't explained to her what capitalism is. So we just had a quick seminar. The result is that she says she doesn't know what she thinks but at the moment she's definitely more like a communist than a capitalist.</p>

<h3 id="a009257">music and handouts</h3>

<p>Don't tell bozo but I think the missing music on my itunes is only missing cos I downloaded it onto a different computer ;-)</p>

<p>Listening to Candyskin by the <a href="http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=fire_engines">Fire Engines</a> just now (thanks, Robbie). Takes you back. This was <span class="caps">THE </span>song for a wee while back in the day. I seem to be sinking in nostalgia at the moment, having been to see the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A1046738">Gang of Four</a> last night. They were great and not really in a nostalgic way. Ended up going on my own as each of my 'dates' fell by the wayside one after another. Felt like a comedy character being there on my own with two big heavy bike bags, one of which had a computer in it, struggling to the bar with no hands free for my pint. I had remembered the Gang of Four as a bit funky and a bit rock-y but I hadn't thought of the rock bit as being as heavy as it was. They were quite industrial and brutal and didn't really sound like they were from the old days. I was delighted while I was there to be slipped a 'Capitalism? No thanks!' free-access card ('can be used to abolish global credit and debit systems') from <a href="http://www.worldsocialism.org">http://www.worldsocialism.org</a></p>

<p>Followed that with a listen to <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,13887,1240051,00.html">metal box</a> this morning. Mike gave me his spare copy last night. Hadn't listened for ages but it sounded great and Albatross is perfect Saturday morning breakfast music. Twenty odd years ago, we used to listen to Theme from the <a href="http://www.fodderstompf.com/DISCOGRAPHY/LP/3firstLP.html">first pil album</a> when we felt disgustedly hungover with ourselves.</p>

<p>At breakfast I showed the kids the worldsocialism card which meant I had to explain to them what capitalism is.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I think I've got a busy enough weekend without not being able to find my old handouts so that I have to redo the handout for Monday's first year class from scratch.</p>

<h2>January 22, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009246">Saturday</h3>

<p>Don't tell the publishers, or the students, or the university, but I took time off from academia today (I know I shouldn't feel guilty about that on a Saturday, but there you go). Followed a nice game of football with a wee game of basketball. Martha takes it really seriously. I think that kind of competitiveness is at its height when you're around 10. I think I was around 10 when I started changing channels to check whether Aberdeen had really lost most Saturday teatimes. I remember one time the <span class="caps">BBC </span>said they'd won 5-0 at Ayr and I changed to <span class="caps">ITV </span>who said they'd lost 5-0. It turned out <span class="caps">ITV </span>had got it wrong. B-)</p>

<p>Followed the sport with a bit of computer play (partial success with using Airport to play stuff off the computers through the hifi system, but a bit of a worry that some of my itunes music seems to have disappeared when Dug fixed the computer) and some house organising. Had to borrow a drill cos I still can't find ours, but it looks like we're getting slightly more organised. Ohna did some major work with the help of Muji.</p>

<p>Just listening to some very groovy oldstyle funk on <a href="http://www.radiomagnetic.com">Radio Magnetic</a> which is perfect for a Saturday night when you're getting ready to go out.</p>

<p>Went to a super gig on <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com">Dug</a>'s birthday on Thursday. Ian Broudie in a tiny room upstairs at the Enterprise. Reminded of when Gentleman Jim played my back living room for my fortieth. Particularly enjoyed the double bass - Kiloh is currently taking advantage of free double bass lessons from the Haringey Music Centre.</p>

<h2>January 16, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009239">back to life</h3>

<p>Dug spent a good few hours today getting my computer back to life. Now I'm cracking on with marking again. Meanwhile, an author who's working on the encyclopedia emailed to say that his computer crashed on him a couple of days ago. He's based in Jakarta and has been travelling in Sumatra where the tsunami hit. Which kind of puts the panic over a linguistics encyclopedia entry into perspective. He was pleased to hear that I was in a similar situation. He then freaked himself out by making this comment:</p>

<p>'But if you hear a news flash of a meteorite smashing into Jakarta, you'll know<br />
it's my encyclopaedia jinx again.'</p>

<p>and then waking up in the morning to find that there had been an earthquake in Jakarta that night (too small to notice, luckily). Hero that he is, he's now typed up the article that he had a hard copy of and also completely rewritten the one that was totally lost. Wish I was working that quickly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, one of Apoa's friends just came round with her parents to apologise for telling stories that weren't true about relatives being missing in the tsunami. Apparently, during World War <span class="caps">II, </span>they did have a relative who was missing for a week after Sri Lanka was bombed and then turned up safe and sound.</p>

<h2>January 14, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a009237">stereotype</h3>

<p>I guess the stereotypical academic has a lot of marking to do between semesters. And is simultaneously trying to squeeze in various things - writing, editing and so on - that got squeezed out during the semester. I guess if your computer melts down making all of the writing work you've been doing inaccessible just when you're trying to get at least some of your writing off before the 'no no this time we really mean it, it really is the really really final final deadline' so that you can then stay up half the night marking but instead you spend a few hours trying to fix your computer but of course you're not a neek so you've got no idea what you're doing and it's probably a big job anyway, so eventually you give up and you  might as well have given up earlier and just gone on to the marking even if the publishers are really going to be going crazy when the stuff you promised doesn't arrive, then it just makes you even more of a stereotype, right?</p>

<p>Topic shift: the new issue of <a href="http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/lore/index.htm">Lore</a> just came out with a little piece from me on being an <a href="http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/lore/digressions/index.htm">academic who blogs</a> Don't suppose this could count for the <span class="caps">RAE, </span>could it?</p>

<li>The Incredibles is great</li>

<li>Bessie and Ted are back at home after separately going to hospital - hope they're going to cope OK at home</li>

<p>Woke up early this morning to make sure Apoa finished the homework that was due today (getting more and more tempted every day to 'throw it on the fire and take the car downtown') and really didn't feel in the mood to go in and teach all day. Wednesdays involve two three hour sessions with an hour for lunch in the middle. But I had such a good time in the classroom that I hereby take it all back.</p>

<h3 id="a006456">a job for Robbie</h3>

<p>I'm really pleased that <a href="http://www.robbiebushe.co.uk/">Robbie</a> has got a new job. It's in Oxford and is part-time, 3 days a week. Another artist told me that she does 2 days a week and that you should never take on more than that if you want to do your own work, but Robbie thinks it will work so we'll see. I think it's really important that Robbie gets a chance to work seriously on his art, like when the main concern of the literary establishment was to 'get Mr. Eliot out of the bank'. (Where did I read about that?)</p>

<p>Well, there's been plenty to blog about recently but no time to do it. When lots of 'real' people and things are waiting for you to do stuff it's hard to justify sitting here typing for virtual entities.</p>

<p>But I've just been woken up on the point of bedtime by the sound of someone being beaten up outside and have been standing in the cold talking to the victim, the cops and a few other witnesses. The police radio was talking about a 'crack address' here but it sounded from what the others said more like he had got pissed and been beaten up by somebody he knew on his way home. Anyway, since I'm not sleepy any more, I'll add a message or two before I get dozy again.</p>

<h3 id="a006407">Avril and the week before</h3>

<p><a title="Avril Lavigne tickets Wembley Arena - official Wembley site" href="http://www.whatsonwembley.com/htdocs/home_whatson.php?cc=76&amp;name=what's on&amp;event=208">Avril Lavigne at Wembley Arena - official Wembley site</a></p>

<p>Just got back from this. We all agreed it was better than SClubUnited, which is the only other concert the kids have been to. We had standing tickets but took advantage of the offer to be reseated at the side of the stage, since the kids wouldn't have seen anything from the floor. Us oldies particularly enjoyed the cover of Blur's <em>Song 2</em> with the bassist from Simple Plan on vocals and Avril on drums.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, we went to a remembrance service for families who had lost babies at the Whittington Hospital, as Apoa's guitar group were playing there. It was a simple service and obviously a lot of sadness there. The guitar group played beautifully.</p>

<p>Earlier still, Kiloh went to her circus class and Apoa missed hers to go bowling for Rachel's birthday.</p>

<p>All of this inspired us to rent a car for the weekend. I'm glad we did as it made all the moving around easier, and we even managed a quick visit to Ikea 10 mintues before they closed, where we picked up curtains and a rail etc. for Kiloh's room. But I must say it reminded me how crappy it is driving around and being close to all the angry drivers.</p>

<p>Yesterday was much quieter, but we managed to fit in a visit from Nicki and Clemmie, who enjoyed capering with her cousines.</p>

<p>Earlier in the week I learned a new German word, 'schnapszahl', when I turned 44. The kids think a 'double-digit' is really cool. Maybe this can be mentioned in my meaning class. To celebrate we went to St. John and the following night we went to a dinner hosted by Fergus Henderson and Anthony Bourdain which was great fun, even though the food wasn't very good (!!). The audience were mean enough to mention that in the question session.</p>

<p>Anyway, sorry to splurt out a whole week (well, bits of it) like that. I'll try to get back to daily postings from now on.</p>

<h2>September 27, 2004</h2>


<h3 id="a006371">busy day</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.sohotheatre.com/plays/77.htm"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/privatepeaceful.jpg" alt="Private Peaceful" width="300" height=113" /></a></p>

<p>After a quiet day at home tidying up the spare room for next week's visit from Daniel and Gemma, and a quiet evening in with just Kiloh at night (Apoa was off sleeping over), with a visit from Clemmie, Dug and Nicki squeezed in (with a bit of guilt as I took advantage of their <span class="caps">SUV </span>for a quick stock-up on cat food), we had a really fun day today.</p>

<p>First we visited circus school where Apoa took a massive step forward in the battle against vertigo and learned how to turn around on the flying trapeze. Meanwhile Kiloh mastered the 'big star' on the static trapeze and developed her skills on the walking globe and whatever those funny things with two steps and four wheels are called. Then we resisted stopping off at Virgin on the way to the <a href="http://www.sohotheatre.com/homepage/default.htm">Soho Theatre</a>, where the matinee performance of Private Peaceful was followed with a discussion and question session with <a title="children's laureate" href="http://www.childrenslaureate.org/">Michael Morpurgo</a> (author of the novel), Simon Reade (writer and director of the play) and Paul Chequer (the one actor in the play). I've been to a fair number of these discussions and this was the liveliest and most fun, mainly because Michael Morpurgo is a right laugh and a great performer. When the host said we should be winding up soon, he said 'Why? I don't have anything on this evening, do you?' He capped it all by having his chair collapse under him near the end. His wife instantly leapt onto the stage, whipped out her camera and took a picture. She says it might appear on his <a title="children's laureate" href="http://www.childrenslaureate.org/">Children's laureate website</a> soon.</p>

<p>The play itself was really great. I could mention the few things I would have been tempted to change (there are always some of these) but the main thing to say is that the script and performance were great, totally involving and 'real'.</p>

<p>We followed that with a quick pizza stop on the way home and an almost instant passing-out from both kids when we got home. Maybe not the best prep for a busy week at school, but worth it imho.</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p>Do you remember back on the 12th of September when you went visiting as many artists as you could in one day in Somerset? And you sent us a lovely card about it?</p>

<p>We wanted to say thanks for the lovely card and thought you'd be interested to know that we received it on Friday after the card had taken a slight detour to Australia and back! It arrived with a note on the envelope saying:</p>

<p>'Missorted to Australia. Return <span class="caps">UK'</span></p>

<p>Well, at least it got here in the end!</p>

<h3 id="a006358">the mosh pit revisited</h3>

<p>Emily from the <a href="http://www.nme.com">nme</a> phoned me yesterday to tell me I'd won two tickets to the launch night of <a href="http://www.koko.uk.com/events_details.htm#wednesday">club nme</a> at <a href="http://www.koko.uk.com/">Koko</a></p>

<p>She had them biked over to me which made me think they were maybe a bit worried about the turnout.</p>

<p>They were gold <span class="caps">VIP </span>tickets, so when we got there Andrew and I had a look for the <span class="caps">VIP </span>area. We eventually discovered that these were the kind of <span class="caps">VIP </span>tickets that let you jump the queue on the way in but not much else.</p>

<p>It's a lovely building and we had a great time. It was all quite relaxed in the beginning and we enjoyed that there wasn't much sense of preciousness about the people. By the end of the evening, we had maybe consumed one kola kube tequila shot too many (OK, I only had one but anyway), enjoyed the <a href="http://www.kaiserchiefs.co.uk/">Kaiser Chiefs</a>, joined the moshers for <a href="http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/entertainment/music/audioandvideo/s/118/118941_download_the_others_this_is_for_the_poor_single.html">The Others</a>, whose set ended with a full stage invasion, and I had been snogged by a delightful young lady who introduced herself to us by stealing large gulps of Andrew's drink.</p>

<p>It's got to be over a decade since I moshed (I'm sure it wasn't even called that then) and I have to say I really enjoyed it, especially the bit where my specs were being bent in two onto my eyes and the bit where I did my spectacular backwards tumble (starting from the floor, not the stage or anything). It wasn't packed, so we remembered that bit in <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0332379/">School of Rock</a> when Jack Black dives from the stage and the audience politely stand aside to let him land on his face.</p>

<h3 id="a006307">crystal anniversary</h3>

<p>Yesterday was our 15th anniversary, but we decided to postpone it until today. We spent yesterday evening at the <a title="APA Show/UK Reel 02" href="http://www.a-p-a.net/productionshow.asp"><span class="caps">APA</span> Show</a> instead. Free drinks and nibbles, and a screening of 'the best' 50 ads from last year. In the <span class="caps">V&amp;A, </span>which was very cool. My favourite ad was the one for powerade with the cameraman running faster than the racing athletes. I think it would have been better if the commentator hadn't mentioned the cameraman at all, though. No doubt it was that old fear of some of the audience not getting it.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labour/story/0,9061,1305638,00.html">story about Tony Blair</a> reminds me that when we were on summer camp and away from the news for a week, we heard of two stories that had broken while we were away and which turned out not to be true.

<h3 id="a005649">the future of the blog</h3>

<p>Yes, I've become one of those who hardly ever posts to their blog. I'm having a think about the future of this blog at the moment, wondering whether to carry on with a mish-mash of everything or try to be a bit more focussed. A good example of a well-focussed linguistics blog is <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/">languagelog</a> which has multiple posters. I'm wondering whether to do something a bit more like that, and/or to focus more on using the blog as a resource for linguistics people. This partly has to do with my return to academia. I'm officially back now and I'm thinking about the start of the academic year and teaching and everything.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we're all just back from our Woodcraft Summer Camp. 84 kids (ranging from 3 to 17 years old) and 16 grownups in a field in West Sussex. Me and Ohna were leaders for the 28 elfins (6-9 years old). It was hard work but also great fun. Highlights were: swimming, the day at the seaside, bivvying (sleeping outside) with the elfins twice, a merrymoot (kind of like a talent show where anyone can put on an act), a pea fair, and a walk with the elfins which left two hours late, meaning they didn't get their lunch until we got back at 4pm, and ended with an unexpected and very steep uphill climb. This was one of two occasions where I thought I might not get out alive, the other being when we had tickets for one ride each at the fairground but there were 5 spare. I made the mistake of giving them to the first five who asked and then nearly being lynched by everybody else.</p>

<p>Maybe the funniest part of the week was when 450 people from a different woodcraft camp moved into the field which we'd had sole occupancy of, causing much border tension. It's quite a challenge to stop all of 84 kids from saying or doing anything that might spark off a row.</p>

<p>We also had a bit of drama with two hospital runs needed on the last night. Both were scary injuries (one from an aerial runway and one from a fire) but both kids were OK after being treated.</p>

<p>While I'm thinking about what to do with the blog, I'll get back to posting a few things before I go off on holiday.</p>

<h3 id="a005633">midnight police raid</h3>

<p> FORWARDED <span class="caps">FROM VOICES</span> IN <span class="caps">THE WILDERNESS</span>:</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>

<p>Brian has been removed in a very sudden police operation - see below. As of now, he is still in Charing Cross Police Station. He suffered hand-cuff injuries and is very agitated. A Bindmans solicitor is handling his case. </p>

<p>It is likely he will be charged in the next few hours with resisting a security cordon removal and with assault. The solicitor has no doubt these charges will not stick and it appears all Brian's concerns have come to pass and a trumped up situation has been manufactured. Apparently the officer who Brian was meant to have assaulted had no injuries. There is a possibility that he will be taken, if charged, direct to Bow St Magistrates Court for the hearing in the morning. As of writing the desk sergeant has refused his bail.</p>

<p>Maria, Kerry and Alexander were with him when it happened and remain on the site, continuing his protest. If anyone can go down there tomorrow as soon as possible with any placards, that would be great. </p>

<p>I will pass on any info as soon as I have it.</p>

<p>Please circulate as widely as possible.</p>

<p>thanks</p>

<p>Emma and Maria</p>

<p><span class="caps">EMERGENCY PRESS RELEASE</span></p>

<p>2.30am, 10 May 2004</p>

<p><span class="caps">PARLIAMENT SQUARE PEACE CAMPAIGNER ARRESTED AND</span> 3 <span class="caps">YEAR PROTEST SITE BROKEN</span> UP IN <span class="caps">MIDNIGHT POLICE OPERATION</span></p>

<p>Brian Haw, the Parliament Square peace protestor, who has spent almost 3 years in a continuous anti-war protest vigil opposite the Houses of Parliament (1), has been arrested and his possessions / extensive protest display removed, in a sudden midnight police operation. </p>

<p>At around 12.20am, he was approached by a number of officers under the command of Inspector Forsyth of Charing Cross Police Station. Apparently, police were concerned about a suspect vehicle, some distance away. They imposed a security cordon under the terrorism act and the area was cleared of other members of the public before an incident took place in which Mr Haw was arrested, and 3 supporters (including 2 women) who were present at the time, were also threatened with arrest. </p>

<p>Despite the supposed security threat the police van did not leave the scene for some time and Mr Haw was last seen being held down on the floor of the police van, having been detained by 4 officers. After Mr Haw's arrest, the suspect car was almost immediately identified to be posing no threat and the security cordon lifted. </p>

<p>Subsequent to his arrest, and despite there being no longer any current security concerns, the remaining officers removed all of Mr Haw's possessions and protest placards from the site. They even commandeered a passing WH Smith news lorry to effect the removal. </p>

<p>In March this year the police told Mr Haw and his solicitor that they were seeking to remove him from Parliament Square but were not able to say which legislation they would employ. This followed a landmark High Court ruling which found in favour of Mr Haw and his right to protest on the site (2). </p>

<p>Mr Haw has long voiced the concern that the various attempts to remove him have been, and continue to be, politically motivated. </p>

<p>Mr Haw is represented by leading human right practice, Bindmans. His solicitor, Michael Schwarz, said: "Brian Haw is peacefully campaigning on perhaps the most significant issue of the day at a place which is supposed to be the very heart of our democracy. It is difficult to think of a more compelling example of the deployment of the rights to protest" </p>

<p>Mr Haw is now being held at Charing Cross Police Station. He has suffered hand-cuff injuries. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr Haw's supporters are currently continuing the protest in Parliament Square. </p>

<p>For more information contact: Bindmans Solicitors: 0207 833 4433 (Brian's on-going solicitor is Mike Schwarz) Maria (supporter on site and witness): 07812 355867 Emma Sangster or Gareth Evans on 020 8806 6272 or emma@drifting.demon.co.uk </p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>1. Brian Haw has been in Parliament Square continuously since 1st June 2001 in protest against the US/UK support of economic sanctions in Iraq, the invasion of Iraq and the 'war on terror'. </p>

<p>2. On 4th October 2002 Westminster City Council's High Court proceedings against him for obstruction of the highway were dismissed on the grounds that Brian was exercising his freedom of expression and assembly under the Human Rights Act. </p>

<h3 id="a005629">one's train</h3>

<p>This was in the <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk">Times</a> today:</p>

<p>One's train is about to leave from Platform 5</p>

<p>By Alan Hamilton</p>

<p><span class="caps">THE </span>worst form of communication invented by man has been made even less intelligble by the intervention of brandsmiths.</p>

<p>Brandsmiths are highly paid people who dream up swanky corporate names for humble enterprises. When four train operating companies serving East Anglia merged, the brandsmiths had a flash of inspiration; the enterprise should trade under the brand name One.</p>

<p>It has not worked. Smoke signals and jungle drums are models of clarity compared with the railway station announcement. The age that has produced the 3G mobile telephone still cannot talk with clarity to long-suffering commuters scurrying through echoing Victorian train sheds.</p>

<p>Announcements used to refer, for example, to the 7.20 Great Eastern service to Norwich. Recently they have been referring to the 7.20 One service to Norwich. Passengers have been bamboozled; were they referring to the 7.20 One service, or the 7.21 service, which is a minute adrift? After passengers complained, announcers will drop the name and say simply: The 7.20 to Norwich is leaving.</p>

<p>In the railway age of privatised unpunctuality, a minute either way would seem not to matter. A One spokeswoman said, however, that, although she knew of no one missing a train as a result of the confusion, there had been negative feedback. We did employ brandsmiths and consulted with customers and staff before deciding on the name One for the new company, she said.</p>

<p>The operator, formed from a merger of Anglian Railways, Great Eastern, West Anglia and Stansted Express, is registered as London Eastern Railways. The name was clearly not catchy enough, given that there is already a train and bus operator known as First, and mobile phone company called 02. The problem never arose in the straightforward days of British Rail.</p>

<p>If any railway enterprise is to be known as One, it should be the Royal Train. But as one always knows where one is going, one does not really need an announcement, does one?</p>

<p>This is a message from E-Julie about a <a href="http://languagelegend.blogspot.com">blog</a> for A Level English language students:</p>

<p><q>Just thought I'd let you know there's quite an online debate going on about language and political correctness on the language legend blog. It all started with Ron Atkinson's racist outburst, but it has developed. Issues raised so far = 'spastics', gay Vs queer, 'chav' and language used to insult working class men, and traveller insults for non-travellers. Am going to change the post when I think of something new to put up, so check it out if you're interested before I wipe the tagboard.</q></p>

<h3 id="a005625">Re: Contact request from www.billyclark.net</h3>

<p>That's great news, Peggy. Of course, linguistics is not boring at all. I think it is something that appeals to a significant minority of people. Let me know if you think I can help with anything. To see how important a subject it is, have a look at <a href="http://www.lang.ltsn.ac.uk/resources/goodpractice.aspx?resourceid=98">this article</a> about linguistics by Neil Smith. It's part of the 'Good Practice Guide' created by the <a href="http://www.lang.ltsn.ac.uk/index.aspx">Subject Centre for Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies</a>, for whom <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org">The Lecture List</a> is currently 'website of the month'.</p>

<h2>April 28, 2004</h2>


<h3 id="a005624">What is an allergy anyway?</h3>

<p>The weekend got off to a great start with <a href="http://www.shockheadedpeter.com/news.html">Shockheaded Peter</a> (thanks Hanna and Cookie ;-) Kiloh was slightly concerned that every episode ended with death but it was a brilliant show with amazing puppetry, sets, music, acting and, of course, death. We were glad that Kiloh had given up thumbsucking before seeing what happened to suckathumb. The big downside was that Apoa lost her treasured watch on the way home. She decided to go back with me and look for it so we were very late home.</p>

<p>Then I went camping with Kiloh in a beautiful bluebell wood near Welwyn. As a tree pollen hay fever sufferer, this was perhaps not the best place to be on the weekend when every tree in the country decided to shed all its pollen in one swoop (I know, Kiloh, you've told me a million times not to exaggerate ;-)</p>

<p>Anyway, the doctor has changed my prescription now and thunder and lightning has driven the pollen away. Kiloh and Ohna showed symptoms for the first time this weekend so I guess there really was a lot of pollen around.</p>

<p>I just found out about a <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org/content/view_lecture/331">talk on allergies</a> on <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org">The Lecture List</a></p>

<p>1,000 dollars a head is pretty impressive, though.</p>

<p><span class="caps">FROM THE STOP THE WAR COALITION</span>:</p>

<p>Tuesday May 18th 2004 4.30pm till 6.30pm</p>

<p>Landmark Hotel, 222 Marylebone Road, London <span class="caps">NW1, </span>(nearest tube Marylebone Road, Bakerloo Line)</p>

<p>George Bush Senior, the architect of the first Gulf war, is coming to London to raise money for his son's re-election campaign.</p>

<p>He will be the main guest at a dinner party hosted by Republicans Abroad on Tuesday 18th of May. Tickets for the event are $1000 each!</p>

<p>Kim Anderson (who went to Sievewrights dancing with Mike) and who now works with Jonathan and I, went out to her garden the other day to be confronted with a muckle great Heron stalking her goldfish, in her pond, in her garden just outside Fyvie and she had to run at it clapping her hands, it took off, somewhat reluctantly, circled a few times, but just came back when she went back inside - bold or hungry? - anyway no sign of her fish anymore.</p>

<p>Kiloh and Anna have been playing at daredevils jumping from wall to wall outside the front of the house (and shouting at strangers, which I hope they've stopped now). Last night I told Kiloh that wall-jumping was not a good idea in the clogs she was wearing.</p>

<p>So then I spent 4 hours in the hospital with her. There doesn't seem to be a significant break so she's wearing a tubigrip, taking ibuprofen, feeling upset cos she can't play football this morning, and explaining how it wasn't really because of the shoes...</p>

<h3 id="a005604">h*l*m*ts</h3>

<p>Well, I think I've decided to start blogging again. Here's one of many issues on which side with regard to I don't know where I stand (sorry, it's deliberately-weird-utterance day, translations on request):</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- Forwarded message follows &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>The London Cycling Campaign, in conjunction with the <span class="caps">CTC </span>(I've forgotten what this stands for), has produced a briefing document on why the current Private Members Bill seeking the compulsory use of cycle helmets for under sixteens should be opposed. </p>

<p>I have uploaded the document to our e-mail group...If anyone has difficulty accessing the document would like a copy, let me know and I will e-mail it to you direct. </p>

<p>I know that there has been some discussion on this list about the pros and cons of helmet wearing so I thought this document would help inform the debate. </p>

<p>The main reasons given for opposing the proposed law are: </p>

<p>The principal threats to children's lives are obesity, heart disease and other illnesses resulting in large part from inactivity. Cycling has a key role to play in preventing these illnesses. Less cycling through a helmet law would aggravate the situation. </p>

<p>- Cycling is a healthy activity, and the likelihood of serious head injury is widely exaggerated. </p>

<p>- Cycling becomes safer the more people who do it. Encouraging cycling is by far the most effective way of reducing risk of injury. </p>

<p>- Helmet promotion deters cycling and leads to poorer health. </p>

<p>- The benefits of helmets are greatly over-stated. </p>

<p>- Many other everyday activities could benefit more from helmets than cycling </p>

<p>- A helmet law would make it a crime for children to take part in a health-giving activity. </p>

<p>Best wishes</p>

<p>Stephen</p>

<h3 id="a005603">a worm's eye view</h3>

<p> I've been thinking that I might have to abandon this blog, but I thought I could afford 30 seconds to forward this on.</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p>The Wrap: A worm's eye view</p>

<p>18 March 2004</p>

<p>Terrorists declare war on evil, writes Andrew Brown. We should know better</p>

<p>Should terrorists be able to influence the outcome of elections? In one sense - and contrary to the impression you may have received this week - the right believes fervently that they should. Every advertisement suggesting that Mr Bush should be re-elected because of September 11 is based on the premise that terrorist crime should influence American voters. It just mustn't influence them to vote for his enemies, as appears to have happened in Spain.</p>

<p>Assume, for the sake of argument, that the election of a Socialist government is exactly what the bombers of Madrid intended. Should this have stopped the Spanish from voting as they did?</p>

<p>The first point to make is that if this is what they wanted, we are not dealing, in the words of one favourite cliche, with mindless terrorism. We are dealing with people much more effective at manipulating foreign electorates than the Bush government, which never managed to persuade more than a small minority of the Spanish people that the invasion of Iraq was wise and justified.</p>

<p>Fair enough. We are dealing with a subtle and determined enemy. Is it still wrong to do anything they want us to do? If it is, we're in dead trouble, because it would make them subtle, determined, and omniscient as well, since they would never want us to do anything which might in fact benefit us. Such terrorists would be figures of superhumanly gifted malevolence.</p>

<p>A worrying number of Bushies do write and behave as if their "War on Terror" were fought against supernatural powers. Barbara Amiel, for example, had an extraordinary rant in Monday's Telegraph: "Eta, Hezbollah and their many lookalikes have one thing in common. They all partake of the satanic nature of the terrorist culture ... a Satan that is evil incarnate, who can seize men's souls and turn them into his subordinates on earth."</p>

<p>She then goes on to compare Islamist terrorists unfavourably with the Nazis and the Stalinists, under whom "certain moral notions such as loyalty, conscience, support of the downtrodden or the innocence of the young, were never entirely dead even in that part of Satan's empire... such pinpricks in the darkness are missing from today's Satanists. No compunction mitigates or limits their murder. Only our actions on earth can stop them but their deeds are so transcendentally satanic that it genuinely leads to the invocation 'deliver us from evil'. One feels impelled to invoke the moral force of a deity against them."</p>

<p>Hang on. Let's take a few deep breaths here, Barbara. Al-Qaida has killed perhaps 10,000 people in the last ten years. Hitler and Stalin counted their victims in tens of millions. It is true that they appealed to some virtues to strengthen their vicious regimes, but so do the Islamists. "Loyalty, conscience, and the support of the downtrodden" are not confined to Nazis. They are some of the emotions appealed to by the jihadis and the recruiters of the suicide bombers.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old British suicide bomber Asif Mohammad Hanif said in the video released after his death, which was meant to justify his murders, "You spend the whole day in fields and then some dude comes with his truck and runs over it. How would you feel? You feel like standing him up, shooting him ... because you have worked for a whole day like that." This is hardly an appeal to an arcane religious principle. What Islam did was to persuade him, despite his British passport and education, that he had more in common with the wretched victims of the Gaza strip than with the free and democratic young people he blew up and mutilated.</p>

<p>Such people make a terrible weapon. But they are not forged in hell. They are made from recognisable human beings, with whom we were probably at school. Soldiering against injustice does seem more popular among young men than being a medical missionary. Our own culture glorifies the rebel, the misfit and the lone fighter against injustice. Jihadi Islam works with those materials. Suicide bombers are as often made in teenagers' bedrooms as in a mosque.</p>

<p>I hope and believe that Islam may be subverted by liberal capitalism, just as Christianity has been. But that happened by a change of hearts and minds, not a surrender to a head-on assault. No religion that has lasted 1,400 years can be exterminated by persecution: it can only be made more brutal and ignorant.</p>

<p>With all that said, I still think the new Spanish government should keep its troops in Iraq. We're all committed to imperialism now. Perhaps we shouldn't have conquered Iraq; I certainly wish we hadn't. But we did, and we must now help to run it as well as can be done. Throwing out Aznar, and Bush, and Blair, is not surrendering to the terrorists. It's an essential defence of democracy, by showing that in a democracy, people who lie their way into war will be punished. But pretending afterwards that the Iraq war didn't happen and that we can make it go away by withdrawing our troops is simply infantile.</p>

<p> We're quite excited that Keisha Castle-Hughes got nominated for an Oscar and Jed picked up on the nice example of structural ambiguity in the <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/snowmail/">Snowmail</a> report on it:</p>

<p><q>Thank you Billy - that's fascinating reading. And being the language hot dog that you are you must have loved the quote for Whale Rider: '...Castle-Hughes was discovered by a casting director who visited her school and had no previous acting experience...'</q></p>

<h3 id="a005597">"pleasures are like poppies spread..."</h3>

<p>Had a great Burns night at the weekend, the first one we've done with kids involved. Everyone joined in and some with great gusto. The kids all memorised small four-liner ones (2 graces and 1 little witticism about the joys of a highland welcome). We consumed decent but not outrageous amounts of usquabae, including some of Bonnie Prince Charlie's liqueur (in Edinburgh Fog as well as on its own - no rusty nails, though). If you fancy reading a bit of the bard, <a href="http://www.robertburns.org">this</a> is one of many well-stocked sites.</p>

<h3 id="a005594">Re: Explain</h3>

<p>Elma asked me who had given Aidan the book. I had to confess it was the naughty neighbours (us). It got worse at the weekend. Kiloh, Anna and Makeda spent Saturday making cigarettes by rolling up paper and colouring the ends in red. Then they dressed up and went nightclubbing while 'smoking' all afternoon, pausing every now and then to drink some 'brandy' and 'champagne' (apple juice really). Hope they don't export this game to school as well.</p>

<p>Kiloh justifies her new smoking habit by saying 'it's better than sucking my thumb'</p>

<h3 id="a005592">debriefing</h3>

<p>I just phoned Apoa who had her last selective exam today - she's still got a music audition and an assessment (which isn't selective) to do. As usual, I turned my lamp on her and asked detailed questions. Now I've got to resist the urge to tell Ohna all about it before she gets the chance to debrief.</p>

<p>Kiloh, meanwhile, seems to have pressed on both the intellectual and physical accelerators at once, with three books on the go at the moment (Lemony Snicket volume 10, Coraline by Neil Gaiman and The Subtle Knife on CD) and also having just restarted football club, gymnastics and swimming and also signed up for tag rugby. This was a first-come first-served deal and she was very impressive at making sure she was the very first to apply, getting straight on the phone to Ohna and filling in the form ready to hand it in first thing in the morning (she's also in the habit of leaving for school 20 minutes before the bell nowadays - the journey takes around 3 minutes door to door).</p>

<h3 id="a005589">high culture, low treatment</h3>

<p>I've been busy as you can tell by the gap between this and the previous posting. Lots of postable stuff has happened but you know, life. I still don't have time to write this, but there does seem to be a general feeling that the later on a Friday it gets the more justifiable time-wasting is, which seems like a bit of a paradox but whatever.</p>

<p>Anyway, I won't tell you about all the stuff that happened over the last few weeks. Instead, I'll start by venting my frustration after spending an hour and a half this morning standing in the cold waiting to buy a day ticket at the Royal Opera House (while reading 'Crime and Punishment' - in for a penny...) only to be told when I got to the sales point that it was one ticket per person - something they didn't mention when I phoned to ask about it last week. I didn't want to go without Ohna and I have an overdeveloped 'let's-just-deal-with-it' module and didn't think about kicking up a fuss until too late, when I phoned up too late for them to do anything about it. So I left with nothing but memories...</p>

<p>As with the last two, the effects were amazing with, inevitably, one or two disappointing moments (nothing as bad as the broomstick stuff at Hogwarts, though).</p>

<p>But if they've done such an amazingly good job of dealing with the relative sizes of the characters, why did the whole cinema erupt with laughter at the end when there were a couple of shots of hobbits next to Gandalf's knees?</p>

<h3 id="a005584">radio lullaby</h3>

<p>We overslept this morning. Seems we're going to have to go back to the beeps as the radio makes us go back to sleep every morning. Kiloh has warned us not to do it tomorrow. It's her 9th birthday tomorrow so I've got a feeling there might be a human alarm clock in the house.</p>

<h3 id="a005582">this one's for the pigeons</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/news/story/0,11711,1105340,00.html"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/pigeons.jpg" style="width:126px;height:76px;border:1px solid #999999;margin:2px 0px 1px 10px; padding:0px;" alt="this one's for the pigeons" /></a></p>

<p> I went to the opening of the Dead Bird Show at the Whitechapel Project Space last night (20 Fordham Street, E1 1HS if you're interested, tel: 020 7377 6289). The theme of the show is the fact that architects have been building buildings which don't allow animals to live in, on or near them (the gherkin being an obvious example, with no nest-building possibilities. A number of artists contributed work, including Sarah Lucas, paul Hamlyn, Peter Doig, Abigail Lane, Chris Ofili and David Harrison who's also the curator. The brief seemed to have been taken fairly literally, especially by Patricia Jordan's contribution 'Dead Bird' (can you guess what it was?) It was a really good, lively show. I felt a bit guilty arriving an hour early and persuading the curator to open the door to me. Within 5 minutes, there were about a dozen people inside which I guess means it all began an hour before he was ready.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in another part of London city, the plight of birds in an urban habitat was also a theme at the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/news/story/0,11711,1105340,00.html">Trafalgar Square plinth event</a></p>

<h2>December  8, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005579">weekend</h3>

<p>The biggest events at the weekend were the christmas craft fair at school on Friday evening where I managed only to spend around 12 quid and then we went to a Children's Classic Concert at the Barbican on Saturday.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/W/wildestories/"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/giant.jpg" style="width:100px;height:100px;border:1px solid #999999;margin:2px 12px 1px 10px; padding:0px;" alt="the selfish giant" align="left" /></a></p>

<p>It seems that these are regular events where the audience has kids in it and they get to be noisy. At this concert, they screened two new animated versions of Oscar Wilde stories, 'The Nightingale and the Rose' (message: women are bad, well at least some women are) and 'The Selfish Giant' (message: don't be grumpy, let all the kids in the neighbourhood come and trash your garden as much as they like). We were told we could come dressed as princesses or as giants, and to bring flutes, recorders or percussion instruments. A lady in a wizard's cloak introduced it and told us when to make a noise. It was blooming noisy when everyone got going. And the older (13-14 year-old) kids joined in quite happily.</p>

<p>The films were good and the music that went with it was great as well, in a fairly traditional lyrical way. It was conducted by Debbie Wiseman who also composed it.</p>

<p>Sunday's highlight was a visit from Tim, Imogen and family who have moved to Bristol but luckily keep coming back because they haven't managed to sell their place here yet.</p>

<p>I capped the weekend by spending a couple of hours at Peter the school newsletter editor's house failing to upload pictures I'd taken at the fair onto his computer. Grrr!</p>

<h3 id="a005577">about The Lecture List</h3>

<p>We've just tried to do something about the fact that visitors to the <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org">Lecture List</a> site have been left a bit confused about what the point of it is. Have a look and let us know what you think of it now. Has anybody got a nice picture of a lecture theatre or a seat in a lecture theatre or an ohp or anything?</p>

<h3 id="a005576">catching up</h3>

<p> I finally saw Tanja last night. We decided it was 14 years that we'd let go by since we last saw each other, so there was a lot of catching up to do. I think Tanja's developments were definitely more dramatic than mine but we've both had exactly two kids in the meantime. We had both been under the impression that Apoa was a bit older than Jan but in fact he's about two weeks older than her. She couldn't believe that I'd forgotten the night of the 6am dog attack. I do remember bits of it, but I enjoyed the bits she filled in for me.</p>

<h3 id="a005574">pea fair</h3>

<p> Tuesday night was our Woodcraft pea fair, which means the kids worked in groups to prepare games or activities and then we dished out some peas to everyone and they went round paying with peas to take part in the activities.</p>

<p>I'm not completely sure what it is about trading or market forces that we're trying to show them but there were some interesting developments. The grownups didn't have enough peas and halfway through the evening half of the kids had run out. So the pea collecting stallholders swapped places with those who had spent their peas and we carried on like that for a while. The Bank of Pealand then announced a devaluation of the pea but still some kids were left pea-less so another announcement came which said that since 'this is woodcraft' some voluntary redistribution was in order.</p>

<p>The other main lesson was for the grownups. On a usual Woodcraft evening we struggle to keep 20 kids focussed but on Tuesday around 50 kids just got on with everything while the grownups stood around chatting.</p>

<p>My main contribution was to look after the hall users group's bric-a-brac stall. In little over an hour I took in around 12 quid for them.</p>

<p>Another example from the cognitive linguists:</p>

<p><q>There was a similar one in a Randy Newman song ('The World Isn't Fair'): 'If Karl Marx were living today/he'd be rolling around in his grave'</q></p>

<p>Just nipped in to Bloomberg's <a href="http://about.bloomberg.com/about/ourco/space/">Space</a> gallery in Finsbury Square. It's a beautiful building with a great show by Goshka Macuga called 'Kabinett der Abstrakten' which consists of a cabinet in the front room, some pillars in the back and a selection of works placed in the library. It includes work by a number of other artists. The library is great and is permanent. Anyone can just walk in and sit around in a beautiful space reading books (if you've got time, of course) and spy in on meetings and workers above and below.</p>

<p>The highlight for me was the suit worn by the first dog in space which was inside the cabinet. It looked very comical but was in fact genuine and not just a corset with a plastic snout stuck on top.</p>

<p>The bad news is that the exhibition ends tomorrow so there's no time to bring anyone else along.</p>

<h3 id="a005564">art music dance</h3>

<p>Ohna thinks Hoxton is a bit like the Lower East Side. We were hanging out down here after going to the White Cube for a 'ritual' performed by Susan Stenger, Michael Clark and dancers in the space now occupied by the latest installation by Cerith Wyn Evans. It was fun hanging out with names that can be dropped and the music (by Varese, Stenger, Debussy and John Cage) and dancing was great. Susan Stenger is best known (by me anyway) for playing bass guitar but she was playing the flute last night. The most funnest thing, though, was being in an unusual space where people weren't sure where to stand or what to look at.</p>

<h2>November 24, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005557">another busy weekend</h3>

<p>This weekend included a visit from Rebecca and Derek who came for lunch with Thomas and Benjamin. It was fun watching them all playing together. They were very excitable in a way I associate with kids who don't see each other very often. We used to go mad whenever we saw our cousins. A big difference between Apoa and Kiloh and my childhood is that being on a farm in the countryside meant that we hardly ever saw any other kids so we always went a bit mad when we did.</p>

<p> We also went to a party where the dress code was '1963'. This was interpreted fairly loosely in general but one guest arrived in a full 1963 England football strip (although the shorts were suspiciously short, imho).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/nft"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/rayh.jpg" style="width:94px;height:94px;border:1px solid #999999;margin:2px 10px 1px 0px; padding:0px;" alt="Ray Harryhausen and friends" align="left" /></a></p>

<p>The highlight, though, was seeing Ray Harryhausen talking to Nick Park about animation. I mentioned this on <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org">Lecture List</a> as well, but I didn't tell them about my shame as I tried to jump the book-signing queue and was told to get lost. My excuse for this terribly un-British behaviour was that I'd been first in the queue, i.e. first out to buy a book from the stand, but then went back to find everybody else, not realising that this would mean losing my place. We didn't have time to wait around and I'm not really bothered about signatures anyway, so we gave up. I did manage to get Nick Park to sign it, though. Is that a major breach of etiquette?</p>

<p>I haven't had time yet to get the book out of Ohna's bag and see what it's like. I know the cover's good, though.</p>

<p> We heard this morning that Apoa got through the first exam she's taken for the two selective schools she's going for. The second exam is next week. Meanwhile, her first exam for the other school is this Wednesday. It'll be good when this is all over, although she is coping with it all very well.</p>

<h3 id="a005555">never leave your bike at work</h3>

<p> I did on Friday which meant it took me two hours to get to work this morning (half an hour by bike). The bus was delayed because of a road closure caused by someone trying to jump from suicide bridge. It's funny how people in London are so used to this as well as to tubes being delayed by people falling or jumping under the trains. My brother saw someone jump under a train recently. It's always a gruesome thought but if it doesn't happen in front of your eyes, then people seem to be able to shrug and carry on trying to get to where they're going.</p>

<h3 id="a005554">a shitload more brevity</h3>

<p>I enjoyed this <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000132.html#more">follow-up</a> to Geoff Pullum's <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/000125.html">post about brevity</a> on <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/">language log</a> but I'm fighting hard not to get all pedantic about the bit of pragmatics in it.</p>

<p>By the way (he said, following the blogger's digression maxim), a linguist once joked to me that she was a pedant, pronouncing it 'peedant'. I still don't know whether the joke was that she was pedantically pronouncing it 'correctly' or pretending she didn't know how to pronounce it thus revealing that she was an amateur peedant. I wonder why I've never looked it up?</p>

<h3 id="a005552">we fought the law and the law lost</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1089158,00.html">This story</a> is number two in the <a href="http://blogdex.net">blogdex</a> chart of most contagious web pages at the moment, beating Michael Jackson into third place and beaten only by a joke from <a href="http://www.thetoque.net/">the toque</a></p>

<p>I must admit I'm not that shocked as I have always thought the American government was really only making a minimal effort to pretend the war was justified on moral grounds, let alone legal.</p>

<p>I'm more shocked by the extent to which the British public seems to be going along with the pro-war arguments at the moment. I was seriously depressed watching <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/question_time/ default.stm">Question Time</a> last night and had to turn it off in the end. The misrepresentation of anti-war views, the squashing of people trying to express them and the extreme rudeness to Vanessa Redgrave really got to me.</p>

<p>For the record, I'm pro-American, anti-Saddam, anti-terrorism and have no problem with Bush coming to visit. But I think it was wrong to go to war in the way they did. This combination of ideas doesn't seem to be permitted at the moment, except in those terrible North London circles I move in....</p>

<h3 id="a005551">On Planning</h3>

<p>Jed sent me this:</p>

<p><q>The Nobel Prize Winning economist, Kenneth J Arrow, was in the <span class="caps">USAAF </span>meteorological unit during World War ll. He quickly came to the conclusion that the medium-term weather forecasts which he was producing were no better than randomly right, and so asked to be relieved of this duty. <span class="caps">USAAF</span> Headquarters replied: 'The Commanding General is well aware that the forecasts are no good; however, they are needed for planning purposes...'</q></p>

<p>It seemed particularly appropriate when I was waiting for the bus with Apoa and everyone in the queue was laughing at the totally inaccurate and constantly updating <span class="caps">LED </span>display saying which bus was supposed to be coming when.</p>

<p>If you have any free time, then <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/">language log</a> is a great way to use it up. I particularly enjoyed Geoff Pullum's long discussion of <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000122.html">corpus fetishism</a>, including the Morrisseyesque comment on certain reviewers who he decides it would be unkind to name:</p>

<p><q>...the only thing a fair-minded man like me can wish upon the reviewers is that they should die in obscurity</q></p>

<p>He followed this post with an (implicit, naturally) <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000125.html">apology</a> for his failure to follow one of Grice's maxims of manner.</p>

<h3 id="a005547">let it be - naked</h3>

<p>I was slightly sceptical, partly because I quite enjoyed the strings. But it is actually very good, and a definite improvement on the original, mainly because it feels like a coherent album now. Mind you, I don't think the relative incoherence made it untypical. All of their albums were a bit disjointed, weren't they?</p>

It was fun to see some of the technicalities and very cool to see Brucie in action close up. What a professional. It took him about three seconds to find the best people in the audience to work with - three ladies called Rita, Iris and Doreen who fell about laughing after every rude remark he made. Some of his jokes and routines must have been travelling around with him for around 50 years. But they're still funny.</p>

<p> Thanks to <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org">Lecture List</a> I went to the Ergonomics Society Lecture last night, which was fun, especially being introduced to concepts like 'hormesis'. I left my bike in town afterwards and went out with Mike and Ohna. So I had the pleasure of public transport this morning.

<h3 id="a005539">stimulants needed?</h3>

<p>I gave up caffeine ages ago (was it one year or two years? I'm not sure). I was having one of those 'isn't parental life tough?' conversations with Alan outside the playground and he told me he's just started consuming caffeine again because he can't keep up with his work otherwise. He starts drinking coffee at 9 in the evening after the kids have gone to bed, so that he can get enough energy together to do some work at home. I'm going to continue with trying to avoid that, though.</p>

<h3 id="a005537">what is a blogger?</h3>

<p>This was one of the questions in our pub quiz last night. It was approximately the only one we knew the answer to.</p>

<p>The quizmaster said about one question ('what are canopus and caloosahatchee?') that this referred to a news story we would all have heard about. But it turned out I hadn't even heard the story. It made me realise that I've been reading books lately and not reading newspapers. I think I'm just keeping up to speed with the top two or three stories every day. On the radio today, this story entered the top three and I heard about it for the first time. I'm not complaining, though. The books have been good.</p>

<p>The answer, btw, is that they're the proper names of the toxic ships George Bush is sending in advance of his own visit next week. And not, as we guessed, the proper names of Jake and Dinos Chapman's two plastic shagging people (well he did say it was topical and 'coming to a head' next week).</p>

<h3 id="a005536">a big amarone</h3>

<p>Ohna came home on Saturday B-))</p>

<p>She had been enjoying some rather fine food in Milan and brought some of it back with her, including a huge wedge of top quality parmeggiano and a bottle of Amarone which was absolutely delicious (for connoisseurs it was a 1999 Villa Borghetti). Apparently, this was the wine which complemented Hannibal Lecter's meal of census taker with fava beans. I remembered it as being a 'fine chianti' but apparently it was a 'big amarone'. Maybe the book is different from the film, or maybe I'm remembering the French and Saunders version rather than Anthony Hopkins. Anyway, it was very good, even if we didn't have any fava beans or anything.</p>

<h3 id="a005535">'he just drove away'</h3>

<p>I missed the beginning of the Flaming Lips because I was at the bar being held up by members of the support band Alfie (I think - they could have been just good lookalikes) so Robbie has described the beginning for me and also explained what happened on his journey home. When we heard that trains were disrupted and he had to get a replacement bus at Bognor we thought he might be in trouble (seeing as how the words 'bugger' and 'Bognor' have been known to go together in the past). Robbie's message:</p>

<p><q>Been to the lips <a href="http://www.flaminglips.com">website</a> to get more info and also to Alfie's <a href="http://www.alfie-uk.com">site</a> which is great. I listened to some of their tracks as well - I think they are even better recorded</q></p>

<p><q>The beginning is difficult to describe as it happened so fast - the music came on (forget what that piece is called) all the balloons billowed out with sparkly stuff - lots of coloured light on audience and on stage - and then they went into the song...</q></p>

<p><q>When I got to Bognor there were three of us waiting for the bus which did eventually come but refused to take us to Chichester as he was at the end of his shift. He just drove away...</q></p>

<p><q>The train people called us a taxi which they paid for - got home about 1.10pm</q></p>

<h3 id="a005534">Flaming Lips</h3>

<p>I had a great time with Robbie in the delightful cartoon town that is Brighton (yes, I mean that in a good way, although I guess I am implying that I'm not certain I'd like to live there). We had a look at the fallen pier which looked great at twilight with raging winds and waves crashing all around it. Then we visited Food For Friends for some partly healthy food and then we went to the gig in the Brighton Centre which took us back to younger days. It's a big 50s/60s municipal building that feels like an odd venue for a pop concert. We enjoyed wandering through empty corridors and rooms with our plastic guinnesses before the show.</p>

<p>All three acts made good use of the video projections behind them, combining little films with live footage from a camera on the singer's mike (I can't write 'mic') stand and, for the first act (Steve Burns) on the drummer's head. Alfie were promising in a Coral/Small Faces kind of way and the Flaming Lips were excellent combining their traditional 'crazy' showpersonship with some serious moments. The showbiz included big balloons bouncing over the crowd, dancers in animal costumes, santa, bleeding heads, singalongs, happy birthday being sung to everyone in the audience who (claimed to) have a birthday, snowflakes being hurled onto the audience and some top pop tunes, including a version of 'Seven Nation Army' being squealed into a megaphone (that was the clincher that persuaded Apoa and Kiloh that they want to come next time). The serious bits were about doing something about things you think are bad (following the communal booing of Scwarzenegger, Bush and Blair) and about the death of Elliot Smith, who did a lot of work with the band and their sound man, and, in this context, about how life has no meaning and you have to work to make yourself happy. They were both introductions to songs. I can't remember which song was about how we all have to decide whether we're going to try to make a change but the song that was about working on making yourself happy was 'Waitin' For A Superman'.</p>

<p>Two other highlights of the day were cycling through the spookily deserted City on a dark windy, autumn-leaf afternoon and then again in the middle of the night on the way home.</p>

<h3 id="a005530">political comment</h3>

<p>John(P) just reminded me of <a href="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/billy/permalinker/?pid=486&amp;blog=bi lly">this post</a> from November 2002 and the 'portentous political comment' in an email I sent him a year ago:</p>

<p><q>Yes, <span class="caps">IDS </span>is just one big open goal gaping in front of the satirists, isn't he? I've been making reference to this story quite a bit in my pragmatics class. Great examples of someone saying something and being taken to mean something quite different, e.g. Portillo says he's not interested in being leader and being taken to mean 'make me leader'</q></p>

<p>I'd feel clever if it wasn't for the fact that every single person in the country who isn't in the Tory party took the same view.</p>

<p>Can't believe they're going for someone as obviously dislikeable as Howard but I agree with Michael Portillo who said that at least he'll give them some definition. But is that really how they want to be defined?</p>

<h2>October 29, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005528">football debut</h3>

<p>Every football fan knows that the first real game they ever go to is always an amazing and unforgettable game. For me, it was a glorious sunny day when Aberdeen beat St. Johnstone 5-0 in the Scottish League Cup, including a hat-trick by Jimmy 'Jinky' Smith who went on to be sold to Newcastle for a then Scotland-to-England record sum of ?100,000 (I've just been checking and it might have been 3-0 in 1966, but anyway).</p>

<p>Last night, I finally got to take the kid (Apoa, Kiloh and Aidan) to their first game, thanks to drastically reduced ticket prices caused by the decision not to play most of the first team in the League Cup. I was worried that I'd let them down by taking them to a League Cup game against lower division opposition with not too many star players on the pitch (although who knows whether there was a future Beckham on the pitch?)</p>

<p>With five minutes to go, Arsenal were up 1-0 and things were petering out when Apoa needed the loo. While she was there, Rotherham equalised and we ended up with extra-time and a penalty shootout (at our end) in which everybody from each team, including the keepers, took a penalty and they had to start again before we finally won 9-8. It was half past eleven and the kids were passing out on their doorsteps when we finally got home. Pretty good value at 5 quid a ticket!</p>

<h3 id="a005526">exam</h3>

<p>Apoa's chance to use my ipod came on the way home from her first selective school exam. This is a school where 1800 kids apply every year and 180 get in. There was a lot of nervousness around, most of it being felt by grownups. Most of the grownups I overheard were talking about how cool their kids had been about it all. One of them said:</p>

<p><q>I couldn't sleep last night, but she's been completely fine</q></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099446987/"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/sidetracked.jpg" alt="Sidetracked" border="0" style"display:block;width:86px;height:140px;margin-right:10px;" align="right" /></a>Apoa too was very cool about it. We had to wait around in a crowded hall for half an hour before the exam. She just sat there calmly making a friendship bracelet while I read a bit more of my current book, which is <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099446987/">Sidetracked</a> by Henning Mankell. It's a really good crime novel, although there were a few moments in it where I've been wondering a bit about the translation (you know that feeling where you don't know whether the original author or the translator decided to put it like that).</p>

<p>Apoa did show one sign of nervousness, though. She went to the loo just before she went in and then thought she needed to go again straight away. By the time she came out of the exam, she didn't need to go any more.</p>

<p>The pencil she used for the exam was 3 centimetres long. I did persuade her to bring in one full-length spare but she insists that these little stubs are easier to use.</p>

<p>The person who sent the post comments:</p>

<p><q>...I'm also impressed that Judge Reagan's office is returning calls about his ruling forbidding a father to speak Spanish to his child...It sounds like Judge Reagan has been getting quite a lot of flak on the ruling. Some community groups have requested to meet with the judge, and others are taking the opportunity to do a little public education on bilingualism. So maybe some good will come of this in the end</q></p>

<p><q>Wow! We just won one! That's so unusual I thought I'd tell you about it:</q></p>

<p><q>When you are lucky enough to live in a good place, you would like to keep it that way. Developers, however, make their money by building new things - not by protecting the old. And they make a lot of money doing it, so they tend to be much more persistent than your average resident/protester. In this part of the world, if the building project doesn't 'fit in' (and most don't) The Town Council gets first vote - and in this case they refuse it. So it moves up the planning ladder to The District Council - who also refuse it. The Developer (who wasn't expecting anything else) now takes the last and most expensive step - he appeals to The Department of The Environment. Now that's a wonderful title ('Environment and all..') but what it really means is - John Prescott! - who, in his office of Deputy Prime Minister is in total control of all local government (stop and think about that for a moment). Now, continuing the amazing magic trick of our Labour Government being more Conservative than ever the old Conservatives would have dared, John Prescott has decided that if it is a building application, it should not only be approved, it should be encouraged. So, appeals, though costly to the applicant, mostly lead him to the approval he was seeking. I have very few arms to fight this. But in this case, I was able to get the hearing moved to our local Town Hall rather than the Inspectors Offices miles away. Some judiciously planted local Press stories generated a large public turnout (40+ ain't much to you, but for a planning meeting here, that's a crowd!) The Building plans (large block of flats on coast) had been discussed to death but by forcing them to look at the plot and not just the building I was able to show that they intended to tarmac the garden completely and provide parking for twelve cars - which would change completely the street scene from the small town treescape it is into an urban parking lot. I thought we had lost it. But just this week I got the notification - the appeal (against our refusal to allow building) was dismissed! Jubilation in Budleigh Salterton!! But to paraphrase The Governor of California: 'The builder will be back'. Yes he will, but his next bid will be more in keeping with this funny town.</q></p>

<h3 id="a005522">FBI Internships</h3>

<p>I enjoyed receiving an email just now from James R. Fitzgerald, Supervisory Special Agent, Federal Bureau of Investigation. to let me know that the <span class="caps">FBI </span>internship programme has now been expanded to include linguistics graduates as potential interns. The message was sent to the Forensic Linguistics mailing list and forwarded on to a different list which I'm on. The first sentence of the email was 'Some of the List members are familiar with me'. I enjoyed both the ambiguity and the echoes of Blur's 'We've Got A File On You' which I'd just been listening to and which had been reminding me of Gilbert and Sullivan's song in the Mikado, 'I've Got A Little List', as well as that joke about ex-Stasi employees getting jobs as taxi-drivers after the Berlin Wall came down (the one about them being great taxi drivers because they 'know where you live')</p>

<h3 id="a005520">language judgement</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.linguistlist.org"><span class="caps">LINGUIST</span></a> readers were shocked the other day to hear about a judge in Nebraska who had apparently told a father not to 'speak Hispanic' to his daughter or risk losing his visitation rights. Apparently, he had said 'it's hard enough to learn English, you know'.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's what happened when another linguist phoned the judge to protest:</p>

<p><q>I was so alarmed after reading the article mentioned yesterday on linguist list (Linguist 14.2777) that I googled the judge's name to get his address/phone number and then I called and left a long message saying that the ruling was harmful and ill-informed and went on to say why this was so, and who I was etc.</q></p>

<p><q>To my surprise, I got a call from Judge Reagan's secretary this morning, responding to my message of last night. She said she has been getting a lot of responses like mine and she wanted me to know that both sides are not coming out in the press and that in the courtroom the judge had said that he is for bilingualism and wishes he were bilingual himself. She said that the issue is that the father was in jail for the first 5 years of his daughter's life and the girl doesn't know him and he wants to speak only Spanish with her and she doesn't understand any Spanish. I told her that linguistically there is nothing wrong with being immersed in a language at age 5 and in fact that would be a better way for her to become bilingual than the 'this is a carro, that is a mochila' method, but that it sounds like the real issue is that she didn't know her father until now and that her current discomfort with her father seems magnified (to her, her mother, the judge) with the additional linguistic difference. So, I still don't think that was the right ruling, and I don't know about the whole 'speaking Hispanic' thing, but I sure was impressed that someone actually called me back. </q></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.omaha.com">Omaha World Herald</a> is now running an online vote asking whether the judge was right. You can find a link to the story near the voting buttons at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>The guy on the bike wasn't injured at all, by the way. It looked like his brakes weren't working but he managed to slow down enough to get onto the pavement, despite the fact that another cyclist who'd just taken refuge there was in his way.</p>

<p> Being a <a href="http://www.hayward.org.uk">Hayward</a> Explorer got me an invite to a breakfast reception plus a tour of <a href="http://www.hayward.org.uk/saved!/">Saved</a> this morning, which was coolissimo. A cup of calm, a mini-muffin, a danish, a short guided tour, a free audioguide, a rokeby venus poster, and getting to see the exhibition before anyone else with only around 40 people in the gallery. Highlights included a letter Mary Queen of Scots wrote the night before she was executed, the burghers of calais on the terrace, some golden treasure from a spanish armada boat, the only spherical astrolabe still in existence, and loads of things.</p>

<p>On the way there, I saw a man nearly die by driving into the side of a lorry who was turning left (the most common cause of death for cyclists in London) just before reading a stencil telling me I was travelling over the spot where a bicycle messenger was recently killed and then being terrified by a car who was passing me as I was about to pass a stationary bus. On the way back another driver shouted at me as he passed me, I think because I wasn't close enough to the kerb for his liking. It's still better than the tube, though.</p>

<h3 id="a005517">spirited away</h3>

<p>Thanks to <span class="caps">UNISON </span>being on strike in Haringey yesterday, I finally managed to take the kids to see <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0245429/">Spirited Away</a>.</p>

<p>It really is a fantastic movie. When it ends and you come back to the beginning, it seems like the beginning was a long time ago and that an awful lot has happened since then.</p>

<p>I didn't think the kids would enjoy subtitles so we went to the Coronet in Notting Hill, which was nicely nostalgic (even though it's changed a bit since our day, including no longer allowing people to smoke) only to discover that Time Out had made a mistake and it was subtitled after all. I'm glad because I now know that subtitles are no problem for them and also because the word is that the dubbed version is a bit dodgy, for example translating what should be 'sorceress' as 'witch' and what should be 'gods' as 'spirits'. I have no way of knowing whether that's right but I prefer the subtitled words anyway.</p>

<p>It was also interesting introducing the kids to the concept 'rush hour' when we took the tube home.</p>

<h3 id="a005516">holes</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/074754459X/qid=1066029392/">Holes</a> is a fantastic book that we all read recently and so we were excited to hear it was being made into <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0311289/">a movie</a></p>

<p>Yesterday, we went to a special preview screening at the <a href="http://www.phoenixcinema.co.uk">Phoenix</a>, which was a charity event to raise money for new seats. It was great fun as loads of people squeezed in for free food and lucky dips and stuff before the film. Probably the most exciting thing for the kids was that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/dickndom/">Dick N Dom</a> were there with a little bit of bogies.</p>

<p>The film was good but there were a couple of creaky bits in the conversion from book to film. We wondered what it would be like for people who hadn't read the book.</p>

<p>We had a problem on the way home when Ohna's tyre broke (yes, it could be described as a hole), so we had to ask Justin to help out with his Hiace. We're still resisting buying a new car, though.</p>

<h3 id="a005515">fight fight fight bite bite bite</h3>

<p>Went to see <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/">Kill Bill</a> last night and it was lots of fun, partly because there was such a huge crowd (largely male and twenty-to-thirty-something) crammed together on the way in but mainly because it's an incredibly impressive movie. There's been a lot of talk about all the other movies it alludes to but for some reason nobody has mentioned <a href="http://www.itchyandscratchy.dk/">Itchy and Scratchy</a> which is by far the most obvious influence.</p>

<p>The plot is simple and 'a roaring rampage of revenge' covers it pretty well (Lawrence confirmed that this will be mentioned in at least one Hamlet seminar in the near future) but I don't agree with <a href="http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/film/features/ story.jsp?story=451658">David Thomson</a> who suggests that in this film Tarantino decided to 'ignore character and conversation'. There's not much conversation but there are real characters, even though they're the kind you get in action movies, and it's very skilful in helping you to get to know them quickly. But it is the 'other stuff' that's the most obvious, including another great soundtrack and some amazing editing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nme.com/news/story.htm?ID=106374">This</a> could be good. I really enjoyed the book, even though it was kind of incoherent, with a lot of repetitions and things.

<h3 id="a005513">above the below</h3>

<p>Went to see <a href="http://www.davidblaine.com">David Blaine</a> with Kim while she was here. She said she had promised Jonathan she'd have a look. I don't think it's as stupid as most people do. I mean, everyone's talking about him, aren't they? I'm sure that's his main aim. And it was slightly interesting to stand there looking up from beneath the above the below.</p>

<h3 id="a005512">tea leaves</h3>

<p>Well, I really could have done without having to spend two hours (and a load of dosh) replacing my bike saddle today after some tea leaves half inched it. Funnily enough, this happened outside the Barbican where I met someone last week who'd just had his bike nicked. I guess everywhere is equally dodgy in London but maybe that bit of pavement is made more dodgy because there aren't many pedestrians there.</p>

<p>Enjoyed Mike's show on Wednesday and had a nice time with Kim and Mike and Gerry then and yesterday, exploring family and other pasts and presents. Being a kid in Kintore feels like a really long time ago now. Meanwhile Bessie and Ted are in Blackpool having a romantic holiday to celebrate the anniversary of their first wedding, which was 60 years ago next week. I can't imagine what it feels like to look back that far over all the things that have happened in between.</p>

<h3 id="a005510">Blair and Brown</h3>

<p>I enjoyed <a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/D/the_deal/index.html">The Deal</a>. I think my favourite bit was when Blair told Brown to say hello to Patsy Palmer (well, I think that's who they meant) on his way out of Granita and when they showed us the real Blair and Brown together right at the end.</p>

<p>I do think Blair's performance yesterday was brilliant as a performance and I do think there was some substance there, but not about actual policies or decisions or anything. What gets my goat, though, is when you hear him talking about the Iraq thing and constantly focusing on whether it would have been OK if they had done nothing at all about Iraq (he says 'we', of course but that word sticks in my throat). Surely everyone can see that there were more than two options available? There are surely a lot of people who think something should have been done but not the things that they have done. Nearly all of the members of the <span class="caps">UN, </span>for example?</p>

<p>The thing I always remember is that Blair stated quite clearly that he wouldn't support Bush if there wasn't a new UN resolution and then changed his mind when it became clear there wouldn't be one. And nearly everybody must see that there was a huge amount of deceit and dishonesty when he was trying to persuade people to support the war. I think he might survive, though. I'm not sure that people care too much about honesty when it comes to politics. I bet Dirty Den would have a fair chance of getting elected if he stood. (Arnie and Dirty Den - now that would be a special relationship.)</p>

<p>Apparently, when some Hollywood producer was told that Reagan was standing for president, he replied:</p>

<p><q>No, no. Jimmy Stewart for president. Reagan for the best friend.</q></p>

<h3 id="a005507">busy family</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.sadlers-wells.com/whats_on/2003_2004/michael_clark.asp">My brothers show</a> is on this week and my family are so busy that I have to go three times, once with Ohna, once with Apoa and once with Kiloh (Stefanie's going on her own).</p>

<p>Ohna did a night a shoot last night so she got home at 6.30 this morning and got into bed in time for me to get up.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, me and Kiloh are only 120 pages away from the end of the Harry Potter book. Only 649 pages in and we're already getting a feeling that something might actually happen soon. <span class="caps">OK,</span> I am being a bit unfair. I have enjoyed it. The Ofstedding of Hogwarts is fun, and the bit where you find out more about his dad and mum and the other growns when they were at school is really good. But I do think it would have been a much better book if the first 650 pages had been reduced to around 100 pages. On the other hand, the kids do like all the detail. Anyway, I spent most of the evening last night reading it and we had to continue over breakfast. Looking forward to another instalment tonight.</p>

<h3 id="a005506">comics for growns</h3>

<p>Did a few fun things this weekend, including skating with Kiloh and her friend Sally, who hurt her feet because her socks were too short. Hope they're mending now. Also went to see a tribute to Peter Tinniswood at the <span class="caps">NFT, </span>which was fun, although I was expecting a bit more talking than we got.</p>

<p>But the highlight of the weekend was visiting our little local library where I not only became a hero by getting <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0298203/">8 Mile</a> out but also discovered that they now stock graphic novels (OK, comic books). The first thing you see as you come in the door are rows of brand new books just waiting to be borrowed. I started by getting a collection of rare and not so rare work by R Crumb called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0747553092/qid%3D1064843029/">Odds and Ends</a>, a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1560974583/qid%3D1064843155/">Daniel Clowes collection</a> that I haven't read yet and the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1840233028/qid%3D1064843237/">League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a> which I also haven't read yet but feel I should before that awful-looking film comes out and ruins everything.</p>

<h3 id="a005505">Raising Victor Vargas</h3>

<p><a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0316188/">Raising Victor Vargas</a> does have a lot in common with <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0113540/">Kids</a>. New York, sex-obsessed kids, realism, realistic dialogue, good performances, a swimming pool,... But it's much less gruesome, with no <span class="caps">HIV</span>-related plot or anything. Believe it or not, it's also got a lot in common with <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0163651/">American Pie</a>. It's more realistic and not over-the-top/cartoony, but the characters have a similar innocence and the same obsession with sex. And there's one clear echo, which might or might not be deliberate, when one of the female characters tells her man that he is 'my bitch'.</p>

<h3 id="a005504">movie massacre</h3>

<p>There's an interesting little story about film in the interview with Emo Philips in this week's Friday Thing:</p>

<p><q>In his absence, some of you may have seen his name attached to the Robert De Niro/Ben Stiller farce 'Meet the Parents'. You probably thought, that must be nice for Emo. But no.</q></p>

<p><q>Philips made a film called 'Meet the Parents' for &pound;22,000 in 1991 - which he showed at Edinburgh, and at the <span class="caps">NFT </span>and which got rave reviews on the arts pages. Universal bought the remake rights and then, seven years later, butchered it in the remake.</q></p>

<p><q>'They put my name on the film in the same way we name streets after Indians we've massacred,' he explains. 'I haven't been to the cinema since. I hated the ending. In mine, everyone died. But then, mine was a film and theirs was a movie. In a film, anything can happen. In a movie, you know exactly what's going to happen. But I've learnt my lesson. I'm not planning to do any more movies. I know my limitations. I'm a good stand-up. A lot of my contemporaries are now writing gags for sitcoms. That's rather like giving up bullfighting and becoming a meat packer.'</q></p>

<h3 id="a005503">Mr. Arkadin</h3>

<p>Went to see a fairly mad Orson Welles movie last night called <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0048393/">Mr. Arkadin</a>, also known as 'Confidential Report' (I seem to be on a run of movies with more than one title). It started off reminding me of the backwards Seinfeld episode but the film it most reminded us of was <a href="htpp://us.imdb.com/title/tt0046414">Beat The Devil</a>, which it was even more hammy than and not as consistently entertaining as (ooh, dangling prepositions, you won't tell, will you?). It was so over the top that it was hard to take seriously and the main character was really horrible, so it wasn't really that engaging, but there were still some fun scenes, including a really funny turn by Michael Redgrave.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Geoff wanted to show me the architecture in Southwark tube station. When we asked if I could go in for a look and come out again, they sold me a platform ticket for 40p, which was quite exciting (you have to come out again within 70 minutes). The station is definitely worth seeing, btw, but the best way is to take the tube there and start from the platform.</p>

<h2>September 25, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005502">Now that's what I call apathy</h3>

<p>Just read this in the Guardian's backbencher email:</p>

<p><q>Arkansas <span class="caps">NBC </span>('Coverage You Can Count On') was in polemical mood last week. 'Carl Miner of Blytheville has gotten a very important lesson on why voters should go to the polls,' it admonished readers. 'Miner was on Tuesday's ballot, unopposed for a school board seat in south Mississippi County. No one voted for him - and the candidate didn't even cast a ballot for himself.' Common oversight, surely? 'Miner says he tried to vote but the polling place near his zone was closed,' reports the channel, adding perspicaciously: 'He says he thinks he gets the seat because no one else was on the ballot.' It was the first time in Mississippi County that a whole precinct had failed to vote. Now that's what the Backbencher calls post- democracy.</q></p>

<h3 id="a005501">free ride</h3>

<p>Saw a kid stealing a lift on the back of a lorry this morning. Haven't seen that for a long time. I think it was one of those moralistic cyclists who finally made him get off, but he made it most of the way from the top of Blackstock Road to the bottom of Highbury Grove.</p>

<h3 id="a005494">Vicky's accent</h3>

<p> Just got back on track with Eastenders in time for Dirty Den's return. They've just done a really bizarre thing with Vicky's accent. Vicky is Michelle's daughter, born and raised in the states, who recently came back to the square to hang out with her half sister and who now also lives with her recently discovered half brother (who, btw, has sexual feelings towards the other half sister, which she half shares but is in denial about), who is about to meet her long-presumed-dead father who didn't die in the canal a couple of decades ago after all. (God, it's like a bleedin soap opera, innit?)</p>

<p>Anyway, Vicky (who is apparently a graduate of the Mountview Theatre School down the road from us) has just come back to the square after going home and then visiting Europe for a bit and her accent has suddenly changed to a slightly weird version of an English one. I need to re-view the omnibus to hear the exact exchange but one of the characters commented on it and she gave a reply which suggested that this was something she decided to do since she had decided to fit in. Since then we've noticed a very English 'a' in 'can't' and then a self-correction when she said was going to 'see a movie' and then tutted and changed it to 'going to the cinema'. Does anybody else find all of this just a wee bit unrealistic?</p>

<h2>September 22, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005493">play</h3>

<p>Had a good weekend with <a href="http://www.r.bushe.dial.pipex.com/">Robbie</a>. Ohna and Kiloh were away camping and Apoa had a number of engagements so it was good to have some company. It was Open House Weekend so we had a look in St. Pancras Chambers, which used to be a big posh hotel and is about to be redeveloped into ... a big posh hotel. Also had fun at a comedy night on Saturday. I had my mind read and Robbie got picked on a wee bit (so you're single? since? did she dump you or did you dump her? somebody else? that's even worse, isn't it?) The main act were <a href="http://www.menincoats.co.uk">Men In Coats</a> who do really good visual comedy, even if they did repeatedly fire a water pistol in my face for a few seconds.</p>

<p>I'm off now (well, not actually moving, but you know) to listen to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/afternoonplay.shtml">Afternoon Play</a> on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/">Radio 4</a>. It's 'Occasional Swim' by Annie McCartney who's really good. The website says:</p>

<p><q> Rosa and Colm meet at their local pool, and romance soon blossoms. But Colm's past requires more than a little explanation.</q></p>

<p>The thing about the guy with a past is really typical of Annie McCartney's work, which often has to do with people working out what the deal is with other people (and often getting it wrong at first).</p>

<p>For some reason, I'm suddenly thinking of the gun in the drawer when David Hunter first moved into the Crossroads Motel, but her stuff is in a whole different universe from that, of course.</p>

<h3 id="a005489">Closure of Linguistics at Durham</h3>

<p> This is really sad news from the linguistics department at Durham, which is definitely one of the best in the country.</p>

<p><q>Dear Colleagues,</q></p>

<p><q>Last June we announced the proposals by the University of Durham to close its highly successful and internationally respected Department of Linguistics and English Language. We have been very gratified over the past three months with the amount of support and solidarity we have been shown by the linguistics community in general and the <span class="caps">LAGB </span>in particular. University administrators themselves have commented that they were surprised by the number of letters they received on our behalf.</q></p>

<p><q>Nevertheless, the university administration has chosen to ignore our research rating, our teaching excellence, our international standing and the arguments of the worldwide community of linguists. It is with deep regret that we let you know that the University Executive Council has decided to close the Department of Linguistics and English Language at the University of Durham. No redeployment is being proposed, although negotiations are apparently in progress with the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, with a view to transferring the linguists at Durham to that institution. However, that move would obviously require the full support (including financial backing) of <span class="caps">HEFCE, </span>and as yet we have no idea whether that will be forthcoming.</q></p>

<p><q>We will keep the list informed of any further developments. Once again, we would like to express our heartfelt thanks to all our supporters.</q></p>

<h3 id="a005488">lecture list</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org">Lecture List</a> project is coming along nicely at the moment. There are a lot of different things to be doing at once, but we're getting there. We've got a data entry screen up now so that anyone can input data about forthcoming talks. We're hoping that kind people will use the form even though we won't be giving the talks much publicity yet. If you hear of anything, please fire away.</p>

<p>I'm a bit disappointed that <a href="http://www.felixfilm.com">this</a> rather groovy project probably doesn't count. If I can get enough stuff done in the next half hour I might try to get along to tonight's event. It's not looking too promising at the moment, though.</p>

<h3 id="a005487">let it be - naked</h3>

<p>The version of 'Let It Be' with Phil Spector's production input removed is coming out in November. <a href="http://www.xfm.co.uk">xfm</a> report it <a href="http://www.xfm.co.uk/Article.asp?b=news&amp;id=13194">here</a></p>

<p>Seems like a pretty extreme version of a director's cut, especially since it's not clear how many directors there were, nor what John Lennon would think of it. I'm quite pleased that 'Don't Let Me Down' is going to be on it, partly cos it's a nice song but also cos the kids used to do a good version of it when they were wee. Mind you, they originally got into Gene's version rather than the one by the beatles band, believe it or not.</p>

<h3 id="a005484">secondary transfer</h3>

<p>Here's a nice long message for you. Looks like they're getting less frequent but bigger at the moment.</p>

<p>Apoa's in her final year of primary school now which means it's time for us to come face to face with the tragic reality of England's education system (actually, the system as a whole isn't bad but the secondary transfer deal is terrible if you live in a decent-sized town or city). Historians will remember that it all went particularly wrong in the 80's when Thatcher decided to give choice to schools and to a small percentage of families, while leaving the majority to worry.</p>

<p>We're lucky in that we have a good state school just down the road from us, even though it's just for girls (until sixth form). Apoa's quite likely to get in there, but we can't be completely sure. I think I've gotten over my aversion to single-sex education enough to go for that if she gets in.</p>

<p>If she doesn't get in there, then the only thing we'll know for sure is that they won't send her to one of the other choices we put on our form (since they'll fill up with people who have put them down as a first choice). So we've decided to let her try for two selective schools, which means I have now to get over my aversion to selection (you know, that thing that there would be none of under a Labour government, according to the writing on David Blunkett's lips).</p>

<p>I went to the grownups-only open evening on Monday and I have to admit I was feeling physically sick by the end of the evening. I think the main cause was being reminded of my problems with selection, but it was added to by the presentations from the staff who said a little about education and a lot about why everyone should think carefully before putting their kid in for the exams and about the standards the kids will need to meet to get in. It reminded me of those helplines where the message begins by asking you to think carefully about whether you really want to be phoning. Then there was the general 'scramble for the lifeboats' atmosphere among the audience, which was pretty unwholesome. I think only one question was a general one and all the others were about the questioner's kid and their chances of getting in.</p>

<p>Last night, we went back for the grownups+kids open evening and got a much better impression. The kids were very friendly and relaxed, and seemed to be enjoying being at the school. Anyway, I guess it's up to Apoa really, and she seemed to think it looked pretty good. There were a few famous linguists and a showbiz celebrity in the audience and a most enjoyable standoff between two cars on a narrow road on the way home. One of the cars had a bus up its exhaust pipe but the other one still wouldn't back down. Glad I'm no longer a car owner.</p>

<p>Robert Elms had a piece about secondary transfer in <a href="http://www.timeout.com">Time Out </a> last week but I can't point you directly to it as you have to pay to get it online.</p>

<h3 id="a005483">i excellent ladri di biciclette</h3>

<p>Some of the Haringey branch of the London Cycling Campaign are off to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286244/">Belleville Rendezvous</a> on Tuesday, since it's got a cycling theme. I can't go but, funnily enough, Ohna came home from the library on Saturday with Vittorio di Sica's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040522/">Bicycle Thieves</a>, as well as both <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105793/">Waynes World</a> movies for the kids.</p>

<p>The kids enjoyed 'partying on', and found both films 'excellent'. It was interesting to see how much they'd dated, which I guess is inevitable with something that's basically just a silly idea and is based on a particular pop culture moment. There was also some humour that had to be explained to the kids, mainly the jokes that were based on the idea that this was a movie made by Wayne and Garth, e.g. product placement jokes and the bit with the subtitled Cantonese where Wayne stops speaking and waits for ages while the translation comes up at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>The Bicycle Thieves is one of those classic movies I've actually seen a few times, but I enjoyed it just as much this time. The actors playing the two main characters were amazing, especially since they were amateur actors, and I've always liked the idea of films with real people and locations in them. Viewing it was also affected by having seen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105151/">The Player</a> where a key event is Griffin Mill's trip to see the Bicycle Thieves, which represents the kind of great cinema Griffin has moved far away from, and also of course has a main character who is driven to badness by the cruelty of social circumstance, which will have a particular significance for Griffin.</p>

<p>Since the videos were due back today, I then had to get on my bike at 1am and go and post them through the library letterbox, taking in a fox or two on the way. I remember seeing my first fox in London, probably in the late 80s, and being amazed. Now it seems like it's only a matter of time before they start applying for council houses and taking our jobs.</p>

<h3 id="a005480">Ballad of a Teenage Queen</h3>

<p> Those lyrics take ages to load, so here they are (sorry I couldn't be bothered to make them lay themselves out properly):</p>

<p>Ballad Of A Teenage Queen</p>

<p>Artist: Johnny Cash (peak Billboard position # 14 in 1958)</p>

<p>Words and Music by Jack H. Clement</p>

<p>(Dream on, dream on teenage queen prettiest girl we've ever seen) There's a story in our town Of the prettiest girl around Golden hair and eyes of blue How those eyes could flash at you (How those eyes could flash at you) Boys hung 'round her by the score But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store (Dream on, dream on teenage queen prettiest girl we've ever seen)</p>

<p>She was tops in all they said It never once went to her head She had everything it seems Not a care, this teenage queen (Not a care, this teenage queen) Other boys could offer more But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store (Dream on, dream on teenage queen you should be a movie queen)</p>

<p>He would marry her next spring Saved his money, bought a ring Then one day a movie scout Came to town to take her out (Came to town to take her out) Hollywood could offer more So she left the boy next door working at the candy store (Dream on, dream on teenage queen see you on the movie screen)</p>

<p>Very soon she was a star Pretty house and shiny car Swimming pool and a fence around But she missed her old home town (But she missed her old home town) All the world was at her door All except the boy next door who worked at the candy store (Dream on, dream on teenage queen saddest girl we've ever seen)</p>

<p>Then one day the teenage star Sold her house and all her cars Gave up all her wealth and fame Left it all and caught a train (Left it all and caught a train) Do I have to tell you more She came back to the boy next door who worked at the candy store (Now this story has some more, you'll hear it all at the candy store)</p>

<h3 id="a005479">Johnny Cash</h3>

<p>Just heard that he died. The first thing that immediately springs to mind about him is his music. I was listening to an early song by him recently called 'Ballad of a Teenage Queen' (lyrics <a href="http://www.lyricsxp.com/lyrics/b/ballad_of_a_teenage_queen_johnny_cash.html">here</a>) which I'd love to make a promo video for, and we were all enjoying the most recent Rick Rubin-produced album last Christmas. The second thing I remember is how he told an audience he had Parkinson's Disease. Apparently, he dropped his plectrum and then nearly fell over trying to pick it up. When he said he had Parkinson's the audience laughed, thinking it was a joke, and he replied 'It ain't funny. But it's all right. I refuse to give it some ground in my life'</p>

<p>They're just talking about him on <a href="http://www.xfm.co.uk">xfm</a> right now.</p>

<h3 id="a005476">punks in science</h3>

<p>Just had an email from Kleanthes, one of the founders of <a href="http://www.punksinscience.org/">punksinscience</a>, who wanted to know whether I was 'the crazy guy with a bike' (I was) and whether I cycled all the way from Middlesex to Bangor (not quite).</p>

<h3 id="a005475">donald davidson obituary</h3>

<p>Donald Davidson was quite a guy. The Guardian had a good obituary of him which you can find <a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,9830,1035408,00.html">here</a> and there was one in the New York Times which is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/04/obituaries/04DAVI.html">here</a> (you need to subscribe to read it, but subscription is free)</p>

<p>When I started working on Davidson I had imagined him to be less interesting than Descartes, the other philosopher I've just been writing about, but as you'll see I was wrong. He wasn't just a philosopher but also a skier, surfer, glider pilot, electronics buff (building radios and tellies for fun), radio ham, amateur dramatist, and a friend of Leonard Bernstein who he duetted with on the piano and who wrote the music for his student production of 'The Birds' (Aristophanes, not Hitchcock). He travelled Europe in the 30s and was later shocked to think that he and his friends had treated the Nazis as a bit of a joke. At the time, he and his friends were 'dupes of the Communist party line' as he put it himself.</p>

<p>I found most of these things out reading his intellectual autobigraphy in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/081269399X/">this book</a>, which is unfortunately reprinting right now so you'll have to go to the library if you want to read it.</p>

<p>I particularly enjoyed reading about his romantic adventures. He seems to have had a thing for exotic names. The love interests he mentions include Dolores Dewilder (when he was around 11, other kids would try to tease him by writing 'DD loves <span class="caps">DD' </span>all over the place while he ignored them and went back to 'smooching' in his hammock), Lola Borgemeister, Tatiana Riabouchinska, Tamara Toumanova and Shirley Bernstein, Leonard's sister. He decided not to follow up his interest in Shirley when Leonard threatened to kill him 'if you do anything with my sister'. 'Those were the days', is Davidson's comment.</p>

<h3 id="a005474">back in one piece</h3>

<p>Actually, I've been back for a while now but too lazy to get back to writing anything here.</p>

<p>The biggest event on holiday was the accident we had on the French motorway. We had a blowout and wrote our car off, but all of us were miraculously unhurt. We each wrote an account of it so I'll post our version of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042876/">Rashomon</a> when I get time (OK, if).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I was just finishing my essay on Donald Davidson when I discovered that <a href="http://webapp.utexas.edu/blogs/archives/bleiter/000206.html" >he died</a>. It's sad news but of course I now need to read the obituaries before being able to say the essay is completely finished. As ever, the bloggers were the first to say anything public about it. <a href="http://www.cddc.vt.edu/jeremy/blog/2003/08/31.html#a1091">Here</a> is one place to start looking at them. B-)</p>

<p>If all goes well, I'll finish the essay I'm working on and send it in tonight so that I can go on holiday tomorrow without feeling guilty. (Yes, I know, just like a student). I'm going to take the old-fashioned blogger's approach and not sit sending emails from the beach or anything.</p>

<p>And I won't be sending any postcards either (well, not to here).</p>

<h3 id="a005472">mel against email</h3>

<p>more from Thomas:</p>

<p><q>well it's the same problem as with the use of web standards, some people (like me) use the word naturally (and don't even know that it is the official translation), but most people still use 'email' mostly because they aren't sure they will be understood (like <span class="caps">AOL</span> TV commercial here...) so it's just a matter of using the word and it will spread. as of the pronounciation of 'mel', it is the same in french and english. and actually, people still using the word 'email' in french pronounce it 'ee'-'mel'...</q></p>

<h3 id="a005471">'mel'</h3>

<p>Thomas writes:</p>

<p><q>about the french 'email', actually, it has been decided by the french standard organisations, that the french word for email would be 'mel', shrinkage of 'message' and 'electronique'. voila :^) &#8212; </q></p>

<h3 id="a005470">pas d'emails</h3>

<p>I was setting various email subscriptions to 'no email' today and I noticed I was setting the French ones to 'pas d'emails'.</p>

<p>Then I read <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/news/0,12597,1002708,00.html">this </a> </p>

<p>'Courriel' doesn't sound great to me (although not as bad as 'consignia' or anything).</p>

<h2>July 18, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005468">crisp twaddle</h3>

<p>At last, some discussion of Alexander Walker that makes me feel like they're talking about the same guy. This is Xan Brooks in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/informer/story/0,1191,1001015,00.html" >The Informer</a> today after discussing The Hulk:</p>

<p><q>We will never know what Alexander Walker would have made of Hulk. After 50 years on the London Evening Standard, the critic died last weekend at the age of 73. Intriguingly, yesterday's Hot Tickets supplement still appeared in a state of denial about this, insisting instead that 'Alexander Walker is away' (in heaven, presumably). In the meantime there came a flood of tributes from rival critics and film makers, many of whom had previously regarded him with open exasperation.</q></p>

<p><q>I never knew Walker but I saw him many times. You couldn't miss the man. He would parade into morning press screenings in his spotless cravat, pass a few waspish comments with the regulars and then take his seat; a little duke presiding over a kingdom of pallid, coffee-drinking serfs. Much of what he wrote was reactionary twaddle, but every now and then he would startle you by championing a film you thought he'd hate, or destroying one you'd assumed he'd love. Walker's prose was crisp, sharp and passionate, and you had the sense that he believed every word he wrote (even when it was patently nonsense). Those morning screenings will be less interesting without him.</q> </p>

<h3 id="a005467">double bill</h3>

<p> First, I went with Apoa and Kiloh to see <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0315327">Bruce Almighty</a>, a classic 'self-centred whingeing twit gets comeuppance and learns to be nice again' movie. You can probably sketch out the story yourself but there were some good funny bits along the way. On the journey, Apoa and Kiloh learned a few more things about the etiquette of London bus travel (that's right - there isn't any). </p>

<p>Then I took them home and rushed off to Enfield to catch <a href="http://www.hooverstreetrevival.com/">Hoover Street Revival</a>, an excellent documentary, directed by Sophie Fiennes (who also directed my mum's wedding video). It's really impressive and she's a very talented director. It's literally a documentary, i.e. it documents Noel Jones's sermons, the people who attend them, and the context in which they take place, but it doesn't have a strong narrative shape and it doesn't really probe what's going on. Which has left some audiences unsure about it. There are stories there, though. It definitely made an interesting contrast with the 'high concept' first feature of the evening. </p>

<p>I wonder what film would be the right one to complete a trilogy of god-related movies?</p>

<h3 id="a005463">a 'volatile structure'</h3>

<p>That's how the vet described Jazzy after she attacked Roxy last week. She didn't do physical harm but did terrify her enough to make her empty her bladder and bowels and leave her too shook up to have her first vaccination.</p>

<p>Apparently all tortoiseshell cats are 'volatile structures' so we don't know whether it will be 'viable' for them to live in the same house. We now have to lock Roxy up when we go out (apparently, they're also sneaky and might well act friendly until we turn our backs). She's definitely doing a good job of acting friendly at the moment. So let's hope it's not just an act.</p>

<p>I do agree that most of the public think we were cheated on the way to the war. There's loads of evidence that doesn't seem to be getting discussed very much at the moment.

<h3 id="a005459">devilled eggs</h3>

<p>We had a barbie on Saturday, partly a kind of 4th of July thing, partly cos it was near Ohna's birthday, partly just for the fun of it and partly for summertime. It was a very enjoyable event. I especially appreciated having guests who were happy to dive in and cook their own food, and watching the kids enjoying themselves. You know that excitement they get when they're running wild at a big do? There was a definite sense of two separate worlds - one for kids and one for growns - which just happened to be sharing a space.</p>

<p>I also enjoyed the pre-party panicking and Ohna's catchphrase for the day - 'I still haven't had a chance to do the devilled eggs'.</p>

<p>And Roxy gave us her first rendition of the disappearing cat party trick, finally showing up in Apoa's room at one in the morning.</p>

<h3 id="a005456">camera thieves</h3>

<p> Well, Ohna just entered her 40th year (no discretion in this family) so we were able to go public with what happened when we bought her present. We got her a very nice digital camera (canon ixus 400 for any techie folk) from a small branch of Jessops in Hampstead (the kind of place we go to cos we think it's nice that they exist even though we could save money by buying online). I'd phoned up to discuss it and get them to keep one aside for me and then it got stolen from the shop while we were trying to buy it.</p>

<p>We had a look at it and the assistant left it in its box on the counter while he pulled out memory cards from some drawers under a display cabinet. When we got back to the counter the camera was gone. Two guys had come in and pretended to look in a display case. Then one of them picked it up under his jacket on the way out. They were captured on cctv but I guess the cops would need to catch them with the camera before they could nail them.</p>

<p>The shop assistants took it very well, sighing and cursing but also smiling and giving the impression it wasn't the first time it had happened. The main thing they said to me was that it was lucky they had another one in stock. It occurred to me that they could have accused me of being in league with the baddies. I suppose the fact that I paid for the other one makes that less likely. It makes more economic sense to get one camera for nothing than two for the price of one, doesn't it?</p>

<h3 id="a005455">cyclists on the phone</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.roads.dft.gov.uk/consult/mobiles/response/index.htm"> This</a> is where you can read about the new law making it illegal to use a mobile phone while driving. It doesn't apply to cyclists, apparently:</p>

<p><q>'The new offence will apply to all mechanically propelled vehicles, including motorbikes. Although some respondents suggested that it should be extended to cyclists, we do not consider this is a significant problem that justifies extending the offence to non-motorised traffic.'</q></p>

<p>I guess they think the person you're most likely to kill on a bike is yourself. There was an interesting typo in the message I got telling me about this:</p>

<p><q>'Some of you may be interested to know that the DfT has recently published the results of their consultation on the use of mobile phones whilst driving ... They have recommended it should be an office to use a mobile phone whilst driving a moving vehicle.'</q></p>

<p>I like the idea of it being an office to use a mobile phone ...</p>

<h3 id="a005454">one down, two to go...</h3>

<p>Well, Ginger Nut has left home now, which is sad but also a bit of a relief. Four kittens is just too many by the time they're eight weeks old and not properly litter-trained. Sparks went to Lily's on Saturday but came straight home because the cat they already have couldn't cope. We're hoping that a neighbour will be taking Sparks and Pusscat soon. Things will be much easier once we know who to blame for the accidents.</p>

<h3 id="a005452">'I need no introduction'</h3>

<p>From the point of view of the <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org">Lecture List</a>, there was an interesting <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,986193,00.html">article</a> by the pianist Susan Tomes in Saturday's Guardian. </p>

<p>She talks about the pros and cons of musicians and conductors discussing a piece before performing it. The main con is that it's difficult for the performers. The main pro is that audiences like it and seem to enjoy the performance more for having had an introduction. She says: </p>

<p><q>Sometimes it was almost galling to be told what a difference one's spoken words had made. Clearly, it did cause the audience to see us as real people rather than... well, I still don't know what the alternative is: frightfully posh people who inhabit a different world altogether?</q> </p>

<p>The main thing I take from it is that audiences are really keen to have an encounter with the performers that's more direct than just watching them perform. Which is kind of what the whole Lecture List thing is about. </p>

<h3 id="a005451">more music</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/fish.jpg" /></p>

<p>Had another busy weekend starting with the school summer fair on Saturday, preceded as is now traditional (well, they did it last year) with the procession of the fish. The route was a bit longer this year, so I'm still hopeful that this could be the start of something big.</p>

<p>Yesterday we went to Kenwood to see the Haringey Picnic Concert with a huge number of music groups, including Apoa's guitar group, playing and dancing in a huge number of different styles. It wasn't Glastonbury but it was good fun. And a lot easier to recover from.</p>

<p>Well, Silvio Berlusconi has gone further than most in celebrating the legacy of Orwell. It looks like he really did describe himself as <cite>'more equal than others'</cite> before getting the courts to agree that they can't do anything about his bribery charges while he's running the country. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,980217,00.html">What a guy</a></p>

<h3 id="a005448">George Orwell</h3>

<p>I'm enjoying all the Orwell stuff on the <span class="caps">BBC </span>just now. <cite>George Orwell: My Life In Pictures</cite> was really enjoyable, although the choices they'd made about how to tell the story were really up front, and there was something a bit simplistic about the main component of the narrative, which was <cite>'bullied for bedwetting at 8 years old leads to lifelong commitment to fighting totalitarianism'</cite> (or is it my interpretation that's simplistic?) </p>

<p>It seems particularly relevant today when parliament is trying to work out the size of the lies that led to the war in Iraq. I'm still not totally sure what I think about the Iraq thing but I know the way our government got us there was wrong. </p>

<p>I'm also enjoying the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/book_of_the_week.shtml">essays</a> being read every day on radio 4.</p>

<p>Today's started with <cite>'Confessions of a book reviewer'</cite> which is very funny and also relevant since I've just been reading Jonathan's review of two books that some editor thought would <cite>'go well together'</cite></p>

<p>That was followed by a discussion of borrowings in English, which was amusing and opinionated. He mentioned a few borrowings from German which followed the war. <cite>'Schadenfreude'</cite> wasn't one of them, though.</p>

<h3 id="a005447">the cats are real</h3>

<p>They're not some ironic postmodern comment on blogging or anything. We've got them all back from Devon now. I joined in for the last few days and enjoyed a combination of swimming, football, park-visiting and lying around in the sun.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I took Jazzy to the vet to be spayed. The vet advised keeping her away from the kittens overnight to protect the stitch, and keeping her inside for ten days until the stitch comes out. We felt really guilty locking her up in the bathroom overnight. But when we got up in the morning she was outside. She'd jumped to the very top of a sash window and squeezed through a tiny gap.</p>

<p>Anyway, she seems to be recovering well. Hope the hair grows back quickly. Without it, you can see just how skinny breastfeeding has made her.</p>

<h3 id="a005443">Dale comes in</h3>

<p>Did anybody watch that programme about Dale Winton's Wedding last night? It was weird. It was purporting to be a documentary about Dale getting married and thus shocking the nation by turning out not to be gay after all. It seemed to be a joke as everything in it was acted and there were weird stories about women throwing themselves on him and him switching from Mr. Ladykiller to Mr. Camp when he was on air. The one thing that made us think it might not be a joke was that it wasn't funny. Intrigued though we were, we got too bored after twenty minutes to watch it to the end. Somehow, the central question wasn't quite as pressing as all the stuff about interest rates and currency management on the other channels. Can anyone fill us in?</p>

<h3 id="a005440">disappearing kitten</h3>

<p>Ohna, Apoa and Kiloh are off camping this weekend while I stay at home to do a big pile of external examining and to try to keep on top of the cat piss which the kittens are trying to flood the kitchen with.</p>

<p>I just spent half an hour panicking when I popped into the kitchen to find only three kittens instead of four. After searching most places I could think of and speculating about various possibilities (Sparks is pretty nimble - could he have actually jumped out through the cat flap?) I put my hand to the back of a shelf full of jigsaws and felt something fluffy.</p>

<p>The experience reminded me of when Apoa was 2 and she ran away in Selfridges, in a huff because we wouldn't buy her one of those little coloured plastic things you put on yale keys. We eventually found her hiding behind a tv.</p>

<p> Brilliant piece by <a href="http://www.simonsingh.net">Simon Singh</a> in today's <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk">Telegraph</a> on Derren Brown. Here's an extract:</p>

<p><q>Derren Brown is one of the biggest TV sensations of the year, and now he is bringing his amazing mind control to the West End. But is he a genius of psychology or merely a skilled magician?</q></p>

<p><q>I don't like to think of myself as a spoilsport. I wouldn't dare question the veracity of Father Christmas, the Tooth Fairy or even the Easter Bunny. But I draw the line at Derren Brown.</q></p>

<h3 id="a005430">'denunciatory support'</h3>

<p> Just read this interesting idea from Norman Solomon via <a href="http://www.zmag.org">ZNet</a> (I've posted the whole message since you can't access it online without paying a premium subscription fee):</p>

<p>A Different Approach For The 2004 Campaign May 31, 2003 By Norman Solomon </p>

<p>Eighteen months from now, citizens will vote for president. If the 2004 campaign is anything like the last one, the election returns will mark the culmination of a depressing media spectacle.</p>

<p>For news watchers, the candidates and the coverage can be hard to take. Appearances on television are apt to become tedious, nauseating or worse. Campaign ads often push the limits of slick pandering. Journalists routinely seem fixated on "horseracing" the contest instead of reporting about the huge financial interests that candidates have served.</p>

<p>Media-driven campaigns now dominate every presidential race, badly skewed in favor of big money. And while millions of progressive- minded Americans are eager to have an impact on the political process, they often face what appears to be a choice between severe compromise and marginalization. </p>

<p>Remarkable transitions occur during presidential campaigns. People who are usually forthright can become evasive or even downright dishonest -- in public anyway -- when they declare themselves to be fervent supporters of a particular contender. Nuances and mixed assessments tend to go out the window. </p>

<p>Too often, "supporting" a candidate means lying about the candidate. Flaws rapidly disappear; virtues suddenly appear. Replicated at the grassroots, some kind of PR alchemy transforms longtime opportunists into profiles in courage and timeworn corporate flacks into champions of the common people.</p>

<p>This sort of dissembling was a big problem in 2000, when many left-leaning supporters of Al Gore ended up straining to portray the vice president as a steadfast foe of injustice. Under the perceived rules of the media game, they could not acknowledge Gore's sleazy aspects or the reality that he had done a lot to help move the nation's center of political gravity to the right. In countless media debates, Gore supporters tried to promote their standard-bearer as an implacable enemy of privilege -- notably unlike the actual candidate.</p>

<p>For a long time, many Democratic Party activists have privately bemoaned the party's subservience to corporate power while publicly extolling Democratic leaders as exemplary. The rationale for this schizoid behavior is that it's necessary for promoting a coherent media image.</p>

<p>There's at least one big problem: For millions of potential voters, that tactic just doesn't ring true. When they're invited to go along with a political line that lauds nominated hacks as visionaries, a lot of people would rather not vote -- or would much prefer to cast ballots for a small-party candidate who has no chance of winning but whose campaigners at least seem interested in being truthful and building an honest movement. </p>

<p>But what if progressive supporters of the Democratic presidential nominee tried something different next year? What if they resolved to be candid for all the world -- including all the news media -- to hear? The contrast would be striking.</p>

<p>Old mode: "Candidate X is an inspiring leader."</p>

<p>New mode: "Candidate X is rather phony, but compared to President Bush he's a knight in shining armor." </p>

<p>Old mode: "The record of Candidate X shows that he will return integrity to the White House."</p>

<p>New mode: "The record of Candidate X shows that he's a craven servant of corporate America. But I'm going to vote from him because George W. Bush is even worse." </p>

<p>Old mode: "Candidate X will bring balance to <span class="caps">U.S. </span>foreign policy."</p>

<p>New mode: "Candidate X is a deplorable militarist, but Bush is even more dangerous."</p>

<p>The new mode might sound a bit strange, even bizarre. But that ought to tell us something -- when candor seems weird and preposterous claims seem quite normal.</p>

<p>Such an approach could attract many progressives who want to end the Bush presidency but also want to be truthful in the process. For those who find the Democratic nominee to be odious but not as odious as George W. Bush, a new option would emerge -- what might be called "denunciatory support." </p>

<p>Candor during an election year may seem like a radical departure with hazy consequences. Admittedly, it's no guarantee of anything -- except more clarity and less obfuscation in American politics. </p>

<h3 id="a005424">what the dudes 'n' chicks are up to</h3>

<p>Just enjoyed this insight into our younger citizens, from <a href="http://www.londonbylondon.co.uk">London by London</a>:</p>

<p><q><span class="caps">THIS ONE TIME,</span> AT <span class="caps">BAND CAMP</span></q></p>

<p><q>Dudes, I just wanted to know if anyone happened to be wandering around the Golders Green area last Saturday from around 9:00 to 12:00.</q></p>

<p><q>If you were then your probably still baffled about what you saw happen. If you were not there, I shall explain what did occur last Saturday night! Basically, all the dudes 'n'chicks in year 11 (15 to 16 year old) broke up from school last Friday, to go on 'study leave' for their <span class="caps">GCSE</span>s. I am one of these dudes and right at this moment I am meant to be 'revising'. To celebrate this two week holiday, *opps did i say holiday? I meant 'revision period' all the dudes from Westminster school decided to meet up at golders green station at 9:00. Yet one friend told another, and in the end chicks'n'dudes came from all over the capital including: <span class="caps">UCS,</span> City of London, Highgate, Westminister, Francis Holland, South Hampstead Girls school, St Micheals and word even got as far as my school (QE Boys) in High Barnet.</q></p>

<p><q>When I arrived at Golders Green station, it was absolutely buzzing, with 200+ peeps just chilling with each other. The chick to dude ratio was about 9:1, so i was definitely In there. After-a-while I went, with these two chicks ,from some french school, to buy some booze in the local 24/7. He denied to sell it to me, which really pissed me of, but God must have been watching, cause some guy gave us his un-opened bottle of Smirnoff vodka to share. And, oh boy, did we share it!</q></p>

<p><q>Around 10:00, someone must have called the cops, so this big group of 200+ went marching up towards Hampstead Heath. It was too dark in the heath, so we continued up to the high street, where we carried on the party.</q></p>

<p><q>In the end, one girl was knocked out somewhere on the street, and everyone else was either (1) harassing the rich snobs in Hampstead, (2) exchanging vodka from mouth to mouth or (3) in a fight. My good friend got attacked and beaten up. I found it funny at the time, and to be honest, still laugh about it now. About 12:00, it seemed to be getting a bit boring, so I headed back home on a night bus.</q></p>

<p><q>God I loving being me.</q></p>

<p><q>Oli, <span class="caps">NW8</span></q></p>

<p><q>[For the avoidance of doubt, this years 'dudes n chicks' quota has now been exceeded. Subscribers should avoid using either or these words in future correspondance. - ed]</q></p>

<h3 id="a005423">(Fwd) cremola foam forever</h3>

<p>from jennifer:</p>

<p><q>Cre(a)mola Foam found as far south as Sheffield? I thought it was an experiment on us Scots only. So did they have the poll tax in Sheffield too?</q></p>

<p><q>When my uncle was a young lad, he used to work on a farm up at Glenlivet. Every day they'd stop off by the burn to have lunch. What better to help waash doon the hale coo inside twa shaves o' loaf than a pitcher of beautiful clear burn water... wi' five speens o' cremola foam (raspberry) added.</q></p>

<p><q>The image of these hardy farmers quaffing cremola foam is imprinted on my mind forever. Fabulous.</q></p>

<h3 id="a005422">sad news</h3>

<p> Just got news that the <a href="http://www.eatmorewords.org">Eat More Words</a> project has been defeated: </p>

<p><q>Hello Eat More Words subscribers.</q> </p>

<p><q>Alas. After months of delays and elaborate plans and hopes for the future and dreams of words, words, and more words, we have some sad news. The powers that be in the land of the <span class="caps">OED</span> Online have decided that <span class="caps">EMW </span>does not qualify for access to their services. Despite our non-profit status through the Apicule Foundation. Despite the fact that other organizations provide online access to the <span class="caps">OED </span>to their members in very similar ways to what we proposed. We've tried to appeal the decision, but have had no luck, and unfortunately have to abandon the plans to provide <span class="caps">OED </span>access.</q> </p>

<p><q>So now we have some of your money and we need to figure out what to do with that. We'd like to offer you a few choices - please select one and let us know.</q> </p>

<p><q>1) Refund the full amount of my subscription/donation (in most cases, $10) </q> </p>

<p><q>2) Refund my subscription/donation minus the Paypal fees we incurred (in most cases, $9.41)</q> </p>

<p><q>3) Donate my subscription/donation funds to the National Center For Family Literacy (www.ncfl.org) or <span class="caps">PEN </span>(http://www.pen.org/)</q> </p>

<p><q>We're sorry this didn't work out as we'd hoped.</q> </p>

<p><q>There are other ways to access the <span class="caps">OED </span>online, if you're interested. In the <span class="caps">US, </span>you might see if your library offers online access. If it doesn't, you can join the Multnomah County library online (http://www.multcolib.org/card/cardnew.html) for $70, which gives you access to various other online databases as well (http://www.multcolib.org/ref/remote.html).</q> </p>

<p><q>We're really sad that we couldn't bring you the heaps of words we'd hoped to, and we hope that you will still be our friends and still send us interesting word-related things when you find them.</q> </p>

<p><q>Best,</q> </p>

<p><q>Caterina &amp; Judith</q> </p>

<p><q>ps. Want to use the <span class="caps">EMW </span>site for something spectacular? Let us know. The best idea (with a demonstrated commitment to actually get something going there, unlike what we did) can have the domain name.</q></p>

<h3 id="a005421">'sometimes when I smile my face aches'</h3>

<p>On top of all that I also had to turn down free tickets at the weekend to see Patti Smith performing at Charleston, Vanessa Bell's (well, it used to be hers) country house near Lewes. John says it was great but you can't do everything I suppose.</p>

<h3 id="a005420">'it isn't easy having a good time...'</h3>

<p>Well, I thought three nights out in a row last weekend was impressive but after I go out for a drink with Eddie tonight, I'll have been out six nights out of seven. Monday was my night in but I went out for lunch with John that day as well. John says the main thing about my blog is that 'you never know what you're going to get' and he sometimes feels like he's tuning in to a soap opera having missed the last few episodes. So here's an omnibus edition just for him (and you): </p>

<p>Last Friday: <a href="http://www.tigerlillies.com">Tiger Lillies</a> in <a href="http://www.lyric.co.uk/lyric/whats_on/music/the_tiger_lillies.html">Gorey End</a>. Thirteen songs inspired by the work of Edward Gorey, based on unpublished work he sent to the Tiger Lillies before he died (too soon, unfortunately, to hear any of the songs). The evening was a kind of 'in memoriam' with Julian Bleach as compere and readings from Imogen Claire, Rosalind Knight, Alan Rickman and Josie Hall. It was a great evening and made me even more fed up that I never got it together to see their Shockheaded Peter last year. I've been enjoying my foyer-purchased CD all week (between nights out). </p>

<p>Saturday: a most elegant party at Rob and Jemima's swish, modern Highgate home (I know they were built 37 years ago as I met the neighbours who moved in when they were new). We started sipping champagne and apple martinis and nibbling sushi and ended up helping ourselves to more drink and fighting the rodeo bull they'd put in their central courtyard. This was karaoke-like in that the evening began with no-one wanting to go on and ended with everyone fighting for the next go. The operator was a bit of a sadist so Ohna made him get on so that she could dump him a couple of times. </p>

<p>Sunday: Neil Young solo and acoustic with no support at the Hammersmith Odeon (well, Apollo these days). They crammed loads of people in and we stood with two rows of people at the back of the circle, i.e. miles away. We passed binoculars around all evening and I tried not to Bogart them. It was a great show. Like the Tiger Lillies, he was presenting a new album. For the first hour and fifty minutes he talked us through a story about Earl and Edith Green, their daughter Sun, the Double E ranch and the community of Greendale. Quite Garrison Keillor-ish. Some great songs and moments, some slightly less gripping. And nice to get a whole narrative, together with some funny bits about how he writes and records ('I wake up in the morning, I think of three chords. I say 'that's it. those are the chords' and I don't change them. That's why all my songs are so simple'). Then he took a break and came back to perform a few oldies. The highlight for me was a speed-hymn version of 'After The Goldrush' with harmonica and organ (and of course Mother Nature was now on the run in the 'twenty-first century' rather than 'the nineteen-seventies'). </p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.neilyoung.com">Neil's Garage</a> for more on the Greendale album (not much yet, though).</p>

<p>On the way home, I was squeezed next to Rico on the tube. I didn't talk to him as two other guys got in first. So I just eavesdropped as he reminisced about his days with the Specials.</p>

<p>Tuesday: Apoa's (ex-)teacher's band's launch party for their new <span class="caps">CD.</span> They were very good, i.e. skilled, competent, etc. But sadly, it wasn't really my kind of thing (even though they jumped around different styles/genres). Read about the band <a href="http://www.meeker-seeker.com">here</a></p>

<p>Wednesday: watched Celtic lose with Alec and Kirsty. A great night despite them losing. Started off in Bradley's Spanish Bar, which is still a really special place. Tiny but everyone manages to get in. And a great atmosphere with 'Itchycoo Park' and 'White Horses' on the jukebox and a picture of Brigitte Bardot and Jane Birkin naked in bed together behind the bar. What more could you want? We then continued the Spanish theme by staying up too late in Bar Sol Ona, one of those late licence places that all Londoners need to know a few of.</p>

<p>Tonight: drinks with Eddie.</p>

<p>Anyway, that should keep John happy for a while. Me, I need some rest.</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<h3 id="a005419">natural foodstuffs</h3>

<p>Jennifer writes:</p>

<p><q>Def no e for me either in that second vowel. but marshmallow was one of my favourite foodstuffs as a kid. In fact, that/those and cremola foam were staples for me.</q></p>

<p><q>Anyway, funny word, so I looked up its etymology: it was originally made from the root of the mallow plant which grows near salt marshes.</q></p>

<p><q>This is disasterous news for me: it means I actually had something natural in my daily diet. Feel I've been had somehow. Bet I now find that cremola foam is derived from brussel sprouts.</q></p>

<p>I've got two bits of bad news:</p>

<p>first, <a href="http://www.ebryce.clara.net/cf/nest_let.htm">this</a> and also <a href="http://www.ebryce.clara.net/cf/default.htm">this</a> which reveals the presence of <cite>'gum, acacia'</cite>. Sounds a bit natural to me.</p>

<p>Still, I think adding vodka to it as advocated <a href="http://www.parsleywood.com/forum/board.php?msg=3895">here</a> would be a good enough antidote to any wholesome qualities.</p>

<h3 id="a005418">marshmellows</h3>

<p>How common is the pronunciation of 'marshmallows' with 'e' as in 'pet' for the second vowel?</p>

<p>I knew it existed but I was surprised to discover I'm the only one in my family who doesn't do it.</p>

<h3 id="a005417">lack of generation gap</h3>

<p> Just checked what's in the kids' discmans (it can't really be 'discmen', can it?). Apoa has <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006J3KF/qid=10529495 05/">Dusty In Memphis</a> and Kiloh has <a href="http://www.whitestripes.com/discs/elephant.html">Elephant</a> (she's taken this over, so I haven't had much of a chance to listen to it yet). They do like TaTu and Girls Aloud and stuff but it's good to see they haven't reached the stage yet where 'my dad likes it' is conclusive proof that something is rubbish.</p>

<h2>May  9, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005413">I want to go to school</h3>

<p>I went with Dug and Tania to an event that was very much a <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org">Lecture List</a> kind of thing last night.</p>

<p>The <span class="caps">NFT </span>is showing a retrospective of films by <a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/showing/nft/archive/krish/index.html">John Krish</a>, who's a top British documentary maker. Among other things, he also worked on The Avengers, and he made an interesting contrast in his introduction between the tantrums and problems when he was on set with Steed et al and the sanity of working with schoolkids.</p>

<p>The films were great in themselves but it was also fascinating to look back in time. Most of the kids were just a little bit previous to my generation but I certainly remembered the various attitudes and looks and fashion statements. Also fascinating to see the institutions as they were then and compare with my own experiences as a kid then and as a parent now. One of them - 'I Want To Go To School' - was commissioned by the <span class="caps">NUT </span>and designed to let parents know what their kids got up to at school. One way things have changed is that most of us know exactly what our kids do at primary school these days and, at least at our place, we're welcome to go in and help as much as we want. (Not in France, though, as Tania pointed out).</p>

<p>There are a million things to say about how the films were put together, the documentary style and etc. and etc. But right now I've got some shopping to do.</p>

<p>You can read more about John Krish in <a href="http://society.guardian.co.uk/societyguardian/story/0,7843,950195,00.html">this piece</a> which was in the Guardian the other day.</p>

<h3 id="a005410">pictures</h3>

<p> The big news today, apart from how the kittens have been getting bigger and fluffier, is that Jazzy has moved herself and her babies out of Kiloh's tiny drawer and into the nice big box we got ready for her.</p>

<p>Apoa's little digital camera doesn't cope too well with cats in boxes but I've put a couple of (quite big) snaps of Jazzy and her babies (current temporary names: Roxy, Sparks, Thingie and No-Name) <a href="http://www.billyclark.net/images/jazandnewbabes1.JPG">here</a> and <a href="http://www.billyclark.net/images/jazandnewbabes2.JPG">here</a></p>

<h3 id="a005409">kittens and kids</h3>

<p>Well, Jazzy our very small cat just had four kittens. We all knew she had it in her.</p>

<p>She chose the tiniest drawer at the bottom of Kiloh's wardrobe for the delivery and did a very professional job of cleaning them up and looking after them. Kiloh didn't think much of watching her eat the cauls and afterbirths as a spectator sport.</p>

<p>There are now four children sleeping on the floor next to the babies. And we're off to sleep with the sound of a contented mum purring carrying through from the maternity drawer next door.</p>

<p>Looking for info on today's elections, I discovered that the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">Guardian</a> now publishes <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/letters/">letters</a> online. I thought the first two <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/letters/story/0,3604,946825,00.html">today</a> were quite interesting.</p>

<h3 id="a005404">vote for jed</h3>

<p>Today's the day my dad-in-law runs for office in the local elections in Budleigh Salterton (in Devon). Enlightened people in 'the Budleighs' (Budleigh Salterton and East Budleigh) are fed up with living in a place where <cite>'if you pinned a blue rosette on a donkey people would vote it in'</cite> and where the donkeys have then gone on to do <cite>'baaad things'</cite> (I'm not really up to speed on it all but I think their worst behaviour from Jed's point of view has been to do with planning - letting developers put whatever they want wherever they want) so some of them have decided to run as independents. Let's hope the electorate seize their opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="a005403">no free lunch, thanks all the same</h3>

<p>We've decided not to bother with the free holiday.</p>

<p>I checked the company's website (Grand Vacation Club) and I've a feeling there might be a catch to do with having to be a member of the club as well.</p>

<p>Anyway, it all feels just a bit suspicious and we know we'll be paying somehow or other. I think the bottom line is that Stevenage is too high a price to pay. We're going to follow Jennifer's advice:</p>

<p><q>go to Cair*i*nbulg instead: no timeshares there: just tons of cultcha</q></p>

<p>(Not sure how long it is since she's been to the Belger, though)</p>

<h3 id="a005402">free lunch?</h3>

<p>I'm quite perturbed by a phone call I got today telling me I'd won a holiday. It's got a large number of the danger signs which suggest that I'm about to be reminded that there's no such thing as a free lunch. On the other hand they claim we only have to pay 34.50 each as a booking fee and then we get flights + car hire + 7 days self- catering accommodation all for nothing. We also have to go to Stevenage and have them tell us all about their holidays (this seems extremely suspicious to me and reminiscent of those timeshare scams which they claim they've got nothing to do with).</p>

<p>I'm deeply suspicious but it also comes at a time when we're desperate for a holiday. They claim to be working with Points of View and Watchdog on a piece about dodgy people ripping people off with scams like this. Maybe I'll give Watchdog a call. Hope I don't end up transferring loads of money into a Nigerian bank account.</p>

<h3 id="a005399">field trip</h3>

<p>Yes, I've been away again. Manchester for the Massive Attack concert and then Sheffield for Linguistics conferencing, including a session on community languages. Found out that:</p>

<p>- 34% of the population of Leicester speak Gujerati</p>

<p>- Urdu is studied by more students for <span class="caps">GCSE </span>than Irish, Welsh or Italian</p>

<p>- 'linguisticism' is thriving in government policy (languages like French and Spanish are treated preferentially compared to languages like Urdu, Gujerati, Bengali, Kurdish, etc.)</p>

<p>- Sheffield seems to be built on seven hills like Rome (went for a cycle in the countryside and tired myself out just getting to the starting point)</p>

<p>- the <span class="caps">USA </span>spends 400 billion dollars a year on military hardware (Russia is in second place on 60 billion dollars a year)</p>

<p>- the Peak district is a good place to look at peewits</p>

<h3 id="a005398">moral dilemma</h3>

<p> Got a stupid blooming parking ticket last week even though I don't even drive (obviously).</p>

<p>I did a quick double-park outside Birte's house while picking up Kiloh and Susie and found a ticket on my windscreen when I got out. Obviously, it was a speedy moded-riding traffic enforcer who got me. If I'd just left the front door open while I was collecting the kids I would have probably been <span class="caps">OK.</span> So now there's a 50 pound bill to add to the best part of 400 I'd just spent on getting the car fixed.</p>

<p>The thing is, I've just noticed that the speedy moped person was hurrying so much that s/he's got one letter of my registration number wrong...</p>

<p>Do you think it's worth the gamble of not paying and waiting to see whether they track me down? If I do, I guess the least I could do would be to broadcast the story on the internet to give them a sporting chance?</p>

<h3 id="a005397">an imitation of honesty</h3>

<p>Well, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007KN36/qid=10500535 83/">elephant</a> is as good as <a href="http://www.nme.com/reviews/11207.htm"> they say</a>, especially the one that sounds like they're hanging out on Lee Hazlewood's porch, but I've gone back to start listening to the first <a href="http://www.whitestripes.com/main.html">White Stripes</a> album, which is very led zeppy. You know, I just didn't like this kind of music back in the day. I did try my hardest for a while before the punk revolution decreed that I wasn't meant to like it anyway.</p>

<p>I like their concept of not using anything that was made later than 1963. Now there's something you can't do on the internet.</p>

<p>Why 1963, I wonder? Could it be anything to do with that poem by Philip Larkin about the invention of sex?</p>

<h3 id="a005395">bad dad</h3>

<p> Well, I've just discovered that Kiloh broke her arm 9 days ago.</p>

<p>She was pushed from a wall (not malicious - she was mistaken for someone who was asking to be pushed) and banged her elbow. As I watched her trampolining yesterday with her arm held constantly at a 90 degrees angle, I thought it might make sense to have it checked out. So I spent today in various waiting and medical rooms and we discovered there's a <cite>'small # in L. radial + joint infusion'</cite>.</p>

<p>Not only did it take us 9 days to take her to a medical person but since it happened we've also watched her trampolining, playing football and drama games, and I even forced her to take her swimming lesson yesterday.</p>

<p>My final crime is that I was joking a couple of weeks ago about how lax it was of her not to have broken any arms yet (I had done two arms out of four by the time I was her age).</p>

<h3 id="a005393">blooming homework</h3>

<p>On Friday I was working in a Northern university so I decided to make it worthwhile by going up a day early and spending half a day cycling in the countryside.</p>

<p>The cycling was great, but I'm paying for it now by having to stay at home to do my homework while Apoa suffers the same fate in the room next door.</p>

<p>One of my tasks is to write an exam paper. Part of the paper is textual analysis so I'm looking for interesting passages to use. While browsing around, I found these interesting pieces I won't be using:</p>

<p>(not online but) Tony Blair in February's Reader's Digest explaining why this war won't be about liberating the people of Iraq but instead about getting rid of Saddam's weapons of destruction. Glad he cleared that one up.</p>

<p><a href="http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,4120,918599,00.html">David Mamet</a> on truth and the withholding of emotion in acting.</p>

<p><a href="http://film.guardian.co.uk/censorship/0,11729,660393,00.html">loads of stuff</a> about censorship. This is especially relevant for me today as we followed Apoa's guitar exam yesterday with a trip to the West End to see <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0252076">Maid In Manhattan</a>. It only scores 4.6 out of 10 on <a href="http://www.imdb.com">imdb</a> but it's a good movie for our kind of family and had some nice relevant bits about coping with nerves (we all had to face this at exam time). It's a 12A which means we wouldn't have been able to take the kids a year ago.</p>

<p>Also on censorship, <a href="http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,4120,923997,00.html">Welease Bwian</a> is an interesting piece about the making and censoring of Monty Python's <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0079470">Life of Brian</a></p>

<p>Damn, Apoa's already finished the first part of her homework and is now enjoying the reward of 15 minutes on the trampoline. I'd better get back to work.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.iraqometer.com/">Iraq-o-meter</a> is keeping track of things in Iraq. They also have this quote from Bush 1 on <cite>'Why we didn't remove Saddam'</cite>:</p>

<p><q>While we hoped that popular revolt would topple Saddam, we did not wish to see the breakup of the Iraqi state. Extending the war into Iraq would have incurred incalculable human and political costs. We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq. The coalition would instantly have collapsed, the Arabs deserting in anger and other allies pulling out as well. Unilaterally exceeding the <span class="caps">U.N.'</span>s mandate would have destroyed the precedent of international response to aggression we hoped to establish. Had we gone the invasion route, the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>could still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land.</q></p>

<h3 id="a005384">raf and sheta shonesh</h3>

<p>Hanna (who's German) writes:</p>

<p><q> these <span class="caps">RAF </span>"wanted posters" they put up in '71. They must have been around a very long time, I remember seeing them everywhere, and I was born in '72. Maybe I've seen them on telly in German crime series or something, but one way or another they have been around extremely long! And I wonder if this is me being extremely pedantic now, because I really would like to know whether someone left out a word by mistake in the Ben Lewis interview (BBC4), or whether he got it all wrong: <cite>'I think young Germans were very guilty about the past...'</cite> I think that's part of the problem many Germans have with their German identity, that they often cannot differentiate between 'being guilty' and 'feeling guilty'. I don't know, but I do think about this sometimes. Did you see that banner on the demo on Saturday, <cite>'For the first time I am proud to be German'</cite>? I quite liked that.</q></p>

<p><q>And then Sean Connery handing over the Oscar. I watched the 'highlights' on Monday, presented by Jonathan Ross, and I clearly remember Connery saying 'Kasherine Sheta Shonesh' (sorry, I'm not pasting in any special (phonetic or other) symbols anymore on this email software since I kind of joked around with funny Greek, Arabic and whatever the other stuff was, letters in an email, and the software sent three digit numbers instead), and then Ross made a funny(not) comment on it, something like 'how he said her surname, that must have been tough for him' (of course it was slightly more 'subtle' than that). So am I just imagining remembering Connery saying the surname? Or did they put it in afterwards? Very strange.</q></p>

<p>My guess on the guilt is that he did mean 'felt guilty' rather than 'were guilty'. On Sean Connery, I do know the answer, though. He said her name when reading out the nominations but not when announcing the winner.

<h3 id="a005381">culture</h3>

<p>Crammed a lot in yesterday. Started with breakfast and a meeting with James and Dug, then a riverside cycle for a quick burst of <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/beckmann/">Max Beckmann</a>, and <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/kapoor/">Anish Kapoor</a>, at the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/default.htm">Tate Modern</a>, a bit of work at the library and a late afternoon seminar (on one way in which <a href="http://www.isc.cnrs.fr/nov/novmenu.htm">children are more logical than adults</a>) followed by a trip to the South Bank to meet Ohna for a bite to eat and the <a href="http://www.gpdances.com/"> George Piper Dances</a> at the Queen Elizabeth Hall.</p>

<p>I didn't really know Beckmann's work which is lively, theatrical and comic (in style even though not always funny). Time Out says the self-portraits are best, and I agree, but I also liked the bronze sculptures.</p>

<p>Anish Kapoor's <cite>'big plasticky thingy'</cite> is really impressive, taking over the big turbine hall and making you feel like climbing in.</p>

<p>The seminar was fascinating. It seems that kids are less likely than grownups to think that <cite>'some cows are mammals'</cite> is false. Or, to put it the other way round, grownups are more likely than kids to make the jump to thinking <cite>'some X are Y'</cite> must mean <cite>'some X are not Y'</cite>. Confused? You will be.</p>

<p>I love the South Bank. The architecture makes you feel like you've time-warped back to a glorious age where there are always lots of people enjoying cultural activity. The people are a good mix of young and old, smart and casual, X and Y. Of course, there's some pattern here - the older ones tend to be smarter. And why are there always busloads of older folk dressed very smartly in ballgowns and evening dress? We weren't convinced that the buses had started their journey in our world. And you never know when a poet laureate will just appear and start signing books next to you.</p>

<p>The dances were great, btw. The first half of the evening was made up of five new pieces by top choreographers accompanied by short films about how they work. At the end of the evening they showed some out-takes and other funny bits. Soon, all dance events will have to have one.</p>

<h3 id="a005380">baghdad blogger</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.dear_raed.blogspot.com/">Salam Pax</a> is fed up with people wondering whether he's genuine or not. I believe him because why not, but you can see why people are suspicious. Here are some reasons:</p>

<p>- it's on the internet where 'you are who you pretend to be'</p>

<p>- he uses a nom de blog</p>

<p>- he doesn't tell us much about himself or other people he refers to</p>

<p>- he writes in English</p>

<p>- his language and style have lots of Western features</p>

<p>I wonder if we should get <a href="http://www.thetext.co.uk/faq.html">forensic linguists</a> on the case?</p>

<p>Has anyone been working on stylistic analyses of blogland?</p>

<p>btw, <a href="http://shakespeareauthorship.com/">Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare's plays</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521417376/">this</a> is the best evidence.</p>

<h3 id="a005379">nuns, whores and femmes fatales</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2003/03/20/actresses/">This</a> is an interesting article by Stephanie Zacharek at <a href="http://www.salon.com">Salon</a> about what counts as a good role for women. She writes:</p>

<p><q>I'll take a lace-and-leather sexpot over Nicole Kidman's prosthetic-honker performance in 'The Hours' any day of the week.</q></p>

<p>It hit a spot with me as I wasn't sure what Catherine Zeta-Jones's reference to <cite>'an amazing year for women'</cite> meant.</p>

<p>While I'm here, was anyone else irritiated by the way Ms Zeta-Jones lost her surname at the oscars? Sean Connery announced that <cite>'the oscar goes to ... [pause] ... Catherine'</cite> (possibly confusing Kathy Bates for a moment) and no-one mentioned her surname again. Was this a coronation ceremony or something?</p>

<p>I liked how <a href="http://film.guardian.co.uk/oscars/story/0,12712,920696,00.html">Xan Brooks</a> described <cite>'Zeejay'</cite>'s award:</p>

<p><q>6.40pm: Heavily pregnant and orange-skinned, Catherine Zeta-Jones steps up to collect the best supporting actress award for her turn in Chicago. Zeejay thanks husband Michael Douglas and confesses that she loves everyone (literally, everyone) in her native Swansea. In the audience, Douglas is most satisified. It looks like the cash he recently spent on that full-page advert in Variety, bigging up his wife's performance, was money well spent.</q></p>

<p>You'll notice <a href="http://www.salon.com">Salon</a> wants you to pay to read their stuff now, btw. You can always pay one day at a time by viewing a 15-second commercial with the option of muting the sound. I found that the sound of 21st-century commercialism blended rather well with Godspeed.</p>

<h3 id="a005377">the German Rolling Stones?</h3>

<p>Actually, I guess I'd like to watch a documentary about the Baader-Meinhoff group.

<h3 id="a005376">another country</h3>

<p> <a href="http://www.baader-meinhof.com/"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/notbaader.gif" alt="nothing to do with me, mate" width="202" height="62" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>Saw another film last night that not many people will be getting to see. <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0309320">Baader</a> is a fictional movie about the Baader-Meinhof group of which only one print is in existence. <a href="http://www.vertigomagazine.co.uk/">Vertigo</a> brought that print to London for one screening last night. I don't know when or if it will be screened again.</p>

<p>There were a lot of good things about the film but it left me a bit unsatisfied. The director said it was deliberately fictional and not attempting to present 'the truth'. On the other hand, it was about real people and some of the scenes were based on what he had found out about them. What disappointed me, though, was that I wasn't really sure what the film was supposed to do to me beyond asking me to imagine a person who was like the fictional Baader.</p>

<p>Found a new late drinking venue after the screening. Do you think it will be sad when they finally scrap the licensing laws and there's nothing special about knowing where you can get a drink after midnight?</p>

<p>Came home and watched half the oscars, which was kind of an opposite extreme from a one-print no-budget arty movie. Steve Martin was funny and not afraid to be offensive. I'm glad some of the celebs didn't chicken out from saying something about Bush and Iraq and everything. I don't know how representative it is, but the main emotions the war is causing in people I've been coming across are sadness and depression.</p>

<h3 id="a005375">starting at the end</h3>

<p> After joining in on the beginning of the last one, we took the other option on Saturday and went straight to Hyde Park for the main part of the demo. I don't know how many hundred thousand were there (I think people think somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000) but it was pretty impressive. The last time, the kids seemed to be a bit unclear about numbers but on Saturday they were seriously impressed when they got on my shoulders and looked at all of the people. Sadly, the photos they took from there didn't come out.</p>

<p>This time we managed to do the whole thing without the kids declaring war on each other.</p>

<h2>March 21, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005374">deep concerns</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.zmag.org">ZNet</a> just sent me an <a href="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=40&amp;ItemID=3293">essay</a> by Chomsky which sketches some of the reasons why we should be more than just a little bit worried at the moment.</p>

<p>I'm still quite sickened by the crude 'arguments' put forward by the Bush-Blair people in support of their war, so I'm grateful for the continuing protests. A journalist on the radio yesterday was suggesting to a Parliament Square protestor that they should go home because the war has now happened and so it can't be stopped. But I think it's important that we try to keep people aware of the way they brought this about, including their constant self-contradictions, the fact that the war is illegal, and the lack of international support for it.</p>

<p>And what are we meant to think of the US claims that their 'coalition of the obedient' keeps growing? According to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2870487.stm">this</a>, Ari Fleischer is impressed by the support from 'countries of every race and faith'. Apparently they have 27 trillion dollars worth of <span class="caps">GDP </span>supporting them, or 35 countries.</p>

<p>Another statement said that 30 countries are publicly in support and 15 are secretly telling the US they support them while publicly pretending not to. Thank goodness for the defenders of openness and democracy B-(</p>

<h3 id="a005371">chunky monkey</h3>

<p> Last night, I became one of the few people in the world to have seen <a href="http://www.eyz-kino.de/filme/chunky_monkey/">Chunky Monkey</a>, a mental movie which was shot three years ago and has been involved in litigation and re-editing ever since. It is incorrect in many ways but the main problems had to do with the main character's fantasy of performing anal sex with Julie Andrews using Chunky Monkey ice cream as a lubricant while she sings 'The hills are alive...' For some reason, there were objections from Unilever (owners of Ben &amp; Jerry's) and the estate of Rodgers and Hammerstein. The film was a lot of fun but I don't know when it will ever be screened anywhere. I got to see it because Lawrence got me into a screening at the <a href="http://www.cobdenclub.co.uk">Cobden Club</a> which is a sort of Groucho-like establishment in <span class="caps">W10.</span> We did a little bit of schmoozing before nipping off for a quieter drink at the Golborne.</p>

<p>Cycling involved a few more hiccups. First, I performed my common trick of forgetting where I was going and cycling halfway to Soho before remembering where I was actually meant to be going. Then I decided to use the canal through Camden only to find they've blocked part of it off. It was nice while it lasted, though. After the pub, some major police activity meant I had to make a great long detour before getting round to my bike again. It was in one piece but somebody had adjusted the front wheel slightly for me. They must have thought the quick release lever operated the D-lock as well as the wheel.</p>

<h3 id="a005363">Jonathan Richman and candles and stuff</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.billyclark.net/images/vigil1.jpg"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/vigil1.jpg" alt="stroud green vigil" width="160" height="120" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>Apoa took these photos at our most local candlelit vigil last night.</p>

<p>Shepherd's Bush scared me (it often does, actually). Gangs of cyclists without lights were charging around all over the place, scaring pedestrians on narrow pavements and arguing with each other. I noticed quite a few bits of bikes chained to railings. I was relieved to find all of my bits still there at the end of the night.</p>

<p>Jonathan Richman gave a most impressive multilingual performance, although to be honest I don't know how accurately he was speaking all of the languages he used. The Hebrew bit might well have been just nonsense syllables with a few velar fricatives (correct me if that's not the right term) thrown in here and there. Still, he was great. He made it feel like he was performing in a little room rather than in front of 1,000 people (I'm guessing). My favourite bits were when he would step away from the mike to say something. First, you were surprised that you could hear him and then you realised that that meant everyone in the place was listening in silence. He was accompanied just by Tommy Larkins on drums, who was also most impressive, btw.</p>

<p>Near the end, he said he'd give us just one verse about the war. The words were:</p>

<p><q>Not in my name in Baghdad</q> <q>Not in my name any more</q> <q>Cos the children</q> <q>We'll be killin</q> <q>Did not put anyone in power</q></p>

<p>Then he went straight into another of his <cite>'wild and crazy'</cite> songs about his night in the lesbian bar with Pablo Picasso warning his ex-girlfriend about the possible drug issues surrounding her new boyfriend, or something like that. He didn't do anything like Road Runner, Ice-Cream Man, That Summer Feeling, etc. etc. But he did do Stop Your Sobbing as a tribute to Ray Davies (since he was in his home town).</p>

<p>On the way home I passed the site of our vigil. It was around midnight and two candles were still burning. Pretty amazing, especially around here.</p>

<p>If you'd like to visit a website about Jonathan Richman, check out <a href="http://www.base.com/jonathan/jonathan.html">this site</a>, aka <cite>'The Abominable Lesbian Vampire Cappuccino Bar in Cyberspace'</cite></p>

<h3 id="a005362">copping out</h3>

<p>Well, you could say this has been an eventful weekend. Big hair dos on Friday, a birthday party + sleepover for Apoa on Saturday, a square dance for the rest of us (with the grumpiest dance-caller of all time, but still good fun), sun, gardening and a bit of a picnic this afternoon, swimming this evening and all capped off with a <a href="http://www.globalvigil.org">candlelit vigil</a> this evening. Our nearest vigil is on an ex-bombsite which is now a 'green space' round the corner, which seems especially appropriate.</p>

<p>But I'm copping out of the peace movement for one night, cos my brother has got a spare ticket for Jonathan Richman...</p>

<h3 id="a005361">from Mark</h3>

<p>Here are some thoughts from <a href="http://www.otherlanguages.org">Mark</a>:</p>

<p><q>Entirely agree on your letter about asylum seekers, by the way. I suggested to Conservative ministers a decade ago that they should set quotas for northern towns, universities and employers to fill by inviting migrants if they wished or not. So as to liberalise immigration by freeing it from the Home Office's dark clutches, and to ensure a welcome in receiving communities, by letting them decide for themselves. After all, I think at least a quarter of houses in towns like Preston and Rochdale are empty. A ridiculous waste. More immigrants are exactly what depressed parts of Britain need [they did an enormous amount for my city, Manchester], provided localities get a chance to positively choose that option.</q></p>

<h3 id="a005359">language testing</h3>

<p>I think I'm adding my name to the bottom of this letter which will be sent to the Guardian and to the immigration minister Beverley Hughes:</p>

<p><q>As teachers and researchers in linguistics, we wish to object strongly to the language tests for asylum seekers that have been introduced recently ("Language tests to uncover bogus Iraqi asylum seekers", Guardian 12 March).</q> <q>As the eminent linguist Lord Quirk said in the House of Lords in June last year, "placing people on the basis of their accent is more parlour game than forensic science". The government says that "language experts" will conduct the tests. We would like to know what kind of expertise will be called upon, and what qualifications, training and monitoring will be used to select these "experts". We are very doubtful that reliable expertise exists to enable people to identify where a speaker of a language comes from.</q> <q>We also deplore the government's emphasis on "bogus" asylum seekers at a time when an impending war looks likely to create a huge wave of refugees. We call on the government to treat all asylum seekers sympathetically and fairly.</q> <q>Yours sincerely,</q></p>

<p>The Guardian Report is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,912311,00.html">here</a> and you can find Randolph Quirk's remarks in the Lords <a href="http://www.parliament.the-stationery- office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds02/text/20610-01.htm#20610-01_star0">here</a></p>

<h3 id="a005355">war and language</h3>

<p>On the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/">Today</a> programme, I just heard John Humphreys (presenter) talking to Terry Jones (writer and ex-Python) and Ian Hargreaves (journalist) about language. Humphreys introduced the piece by saying that some have said that <cite>'if the first casualty of war is truth, the second is the English language'</cite></p>

<p>Humphreys didn't want to get political. Terry Jones, on the other hand, began by using the word <cite>war</cite> as an example. In his dictionary, war is a fight between armed people. In this case, the US has forced Iraq to disarm and is now going to bomb them. <cite>That's not a war; that's a turkey shoot'</cite>. Later, he discussed the use of the phrase <cite>'attack Saddam'</cite> to refer to <cite>'bombing hundreds of thousands of innocent people'</cite> while Saddam makes himself safe in a bunker somewhere.</p>

<p>Near the end, Humphreys said that while he believed the <span class="caps">BBC </span>was non-partisan (polite coughs - or were they giggles? - from the others), they did tend to use the phrase <cite>'collateral damage'</cite> rather than <cite>'children being blown to bits'</cite>. Hargreaves responded by saying he hoped people would switch off immediately if they did ever do things like that.</p>

<p>You can hear the clip from <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/listen/listen.shtml">here</a> if you've got the patience to work out how to get to clip 6 and then move forward to the last fifth (roughly) of it.</p>

<p> Just had breakfast with my brother. On the way out a man with a hangover who was sipping an alka-seltzer at the counter asked Mike if we were father and son or brothers.

<h3 id="a005346">tenimeminem</h3>

<p>Apoa is ten today and I'm sorry to have to tell Fiona that I just gave her the 8 Mile soundtrack as a present. She's been into Eminem for a while but only found out at the weekend that I had all of his CDs guiltily hiding on a grownup shelf. Aidan was a bit surprised to find that I don't think Eminem is the devil. In fact, it seems like there's a bit of a movement to 'kiss his ass' among the middle class chatterers of North London.</p>

<p>Apoa and her mates don't only like him because of the 'plop-plop poo-poo' value of the swearing and she does say that there are some of the songs she doesn't like ('Kim', unsurprisingly, for example). She is currently setting her CD player to wake her with the 'public service announcement' announcing that the artiste does not make a defecatory donation what the listener might think if him, nay! he has said artiste's permission to fellate said artiste, and that the purchaser of this musical compact disc has, in the act of purchasing, performed an anal osculatory act in so doing (or words to that effect).</p>

<p>Diane (who has a 14 year old daughter) thinks it's important not to take too much of an interest in your kid's musical experiences when they're teenagers. So I'll have to train myself not to try to 'own' her music (or to giggle too much at the 'plop-plops')</p>

<h2>March  3, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005345">boycotts</h3>

<p> Here's what the <span class="caps">LSA </span>(Linguistic Society of America) just resolved:</p>

<p><q>At the 77th Annual Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America held 2-5 January 2003 in Atlanta, Georgia, the members attending the business meeting approved the following resolution opposing discrimination and political sanctions against scholars on the basis of their ethnicity, religion or country of origin. The resolution arose in response to sanctions in several European countries against scholarly collaboration with Israeli or Jewish linguists and other academics. These moves are intended to protest Israel's treatment of the Palestinians but target individuals irrespective of their personal stance on the issues involved. The text of the resolution follows:</q></p>

<p><q>Whereas there have been calls for and instances of boycotts of individual scholars (faculty, students and administration) and their universities, in response to the actions and policies of the governments of the countries or regions where these scholars work, or to the scholars' religion or ethnicity,</q> </p>

<p><q>Let it be resolved that</q></p>

<p><q>The Linguistic Society of America opposes all discrimination and political sanctions against scholars in any aspect of professional life (such as employment, publication, promotion, conference participation, educational exchanges, and research collaboration), where such discrimination is based not on the conduct of the scholars themselves, but solely on the scholars' religion or ethnicity, or on the actions or policies of the countries or regions in which these scholars live and work, or of which they are citizens. Such boycotts violate the principle of free scientific interaction and cooperation, and they constitute arbitrary and selective applications of collective punishment.</q> </p>

<p><q> This resolution will be sent to the full membership of the Society for their consideration.</q></p>

<p>I think they're right. I might think differently if it were part of a larger boycott that had had more discussion, especially with the people it's designed to help. But boycotting individuals in this context seems to me to do more harm than good.</p>

<h3 id="a005344">from Fiona</h3>

<p> <q>Hi Billy,</q></p>

<p><q>I just wanted to let you know how much I've enjoyed browsing through your thoughts of the last few months. I'm an old friend of your Mum's and of Kim's, I think we met briefly at Bessie and Ted's wedding - I was the one with the 3 children who all managed to disgrace themselves in equal quantities that night for one reason or another!</q></p>

<p><q>It was the David Bowie dream which prompted me to write - the dream to the tune of Starman? I thought that was just priceless - "chasing after me, eating up my tea" - just wonderful.</q> </p>

<p><q>My daughter Natalie has discovered Bowie at the tender age of 13, (you still have to encounter 13 from your two girls) - beware - tonight I have been called a bitch and a coward but "knock off the a r d" Good eh? And they talk about the joys of parenthood. Yes, I do remember your two charming little girls, with small red tartan kilts and thick wooly tights, girls who were impeccably behaved at Grandma's wedding, this is why I am writing to warn you........ ....... beware the ides of teenage years, when it all begins, you do wonder if your own puberty has only just gone. Small snippets of guilt rear their ugly heads as you remember vaguely snarling at parents in a similar (albeit with curbed language) fashion. Can you not steer the dear child towards the Beatles or something similar?</q> </p>

<p><q>Good luck! And if you are talking to your Mum or to Michael tell them Fiona said hi!</q></p>

<h3 id="a005343">a 'pedant' (;-)) writes !!</h3>

<p>The anti-frivolous bastardisation person has just said:</p>

<p><q>Just to confirm that my original post:</q></p>

<p><q>'Frankly, this kind of issue is nothing compared to the endless colon, dash, end brackets that I see being used so frequently online. This, and such variants as semicolon, dash, end bracket and colon, dash, capital o are ruinous to online textual integrity.</q></p>

<p><q>Frivolous bastardisation of our punctuation is one of the key witnesses to the current decline of our wonderful nation.'</q></p>

<p><q>Was indeed a joke. :-) (did you wonder why I didn't actually write a smiley in it?)</q></p>

<p><q>In fact, I use far too many dashes, unnecessary inverted commas, capitalisations and exclamation marks, and unnecessary repetition in my writing to be textually 'accurate' - so there!</q></p>

<p><q>Also, I write the word 'website', not Web site, or web site. Double 'so there'!!</q></p>

<p>This reminds me of a recent debate caused by Dame Edna Everage saying bad things in Vanity Fair and being taken seriously. The <a href="http://pombostrans.blogspot.com/">enigmatic mermaid</a> posted it and you can read the original post and some interesting comments about it <a href="http://pombostrans.blogspot.com/2003_02_02_pombostrans_archive.h tml#90280991">here</a></p>

<h3 id="a005342">being a pedant doesn't help sell stuff</h3>

<p>This question on a list for net marketing people:</p>

<p><q>A bit of a pedantic grammar question here. When writing sentences for web pages that contain a <span class="caps">URL </span>or email address at the end should the sentence finish with a full stop or not. The approach taken seems to vary on the sites I've reviewed.</q></p>

<p>stimulated a fair amount of discussion, including this comment:</p>

<p><q>Frivolous bastardisation of our punctuation is one of the key witnesses to the current decline of our wonderful nation.</q></p>

<p>(He might have been joking, of course).</p>

<p>The consensus, though, seemed to be more with this response to the anti-frivolous bastardisation person:</p>

<p><q>straight from the telegraph comment pages!</q></p>

<p><q>utter nonsense of course. what works on the page doesn't necessarily work on screen. simple as that. punctuation which doesn't follow 'the rules' but makes screen text easier to read is fine by me and would be fine by most people reading it. being a pedant doesn't help sell stuff!</q></p>

<p>I can't help noticing the violation of the 'no exclamation marks' rule though ;-) !</p>

<h2>February 17, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005335">licensed to drive too fast</h3>

<p>First day of half-term. I just took Apoa, Kiloh and Oisin to the <a href="http://www.jamesbondexhibition.com">007 exhibition</a> at the Science Museum. I was a bit disappointed as the main event was queueing up to answer questions on computer screens, something that's easier to do if you're sitting at home. What interested me most were the design drawings and storyboards, but it's hard to look at them properly when you've got three kids to look after (and to help with the quiz questions on their monitors). I was also less than impressed that the <cite>'death-defying stunt'</cite> they promised meant holding onto a girder and looking at yourself on a screen clinging on to the Golden Gate bridge. The effect was slightly spoiled by the poor quality of the image and the fact that other folk in the room were walking around in the sky behind you. Oh well.</p>

<p>It was also interesting to head into town on the first day of congestion charging. The tubes didn't seem any busier than usual (although I don't use them that often) but crossing roads with kids in South Kensington made clear what I think is the main flaw with the scheme. If the scheme <cite>'works'</cite> then traffic will be able to get around faster. The last thing we want cars to do is to speed up. Up until now, the scariest bit about cycling in London has been being passed by cars going too fast and passing too close. This is usually less of a problem in town than our here in the boondocks. Hope this scheme isn't going to change that. I've always thought that banning cars altogether is the best way to deal with traffic, but maybe this is just the first step?</p>

<h2>February 15, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005333">half a demo</h3>

<p>Well, we're home already.</p>

<p>The kids declared war on each other before we even left the house, which was not a good omen. Their friend Guy was bringing his catapult on the march so he could sort out any Iraqis he might meet. Not sure he's really with the programme.</p>

<p>We waited at Finsbury Park for half an hour then tubed to Russell Square. An hour and a half later we'd made it to Bedford Square and at that point I gave in and took the kids home.</p>

<p>We enjoyed the bit we joined in on though. The kids were impressed by the noise every time a wave of shouting passed through the crowd and we enjoyed various chants, banners, drummers, and stuff. I enjoyed being out in a crowd of amiable grownups. I had more conversations with strangers in two hours than I usually manage in a month, including people on the tube who weren't going to the demo.</p>

<p>I would have liked to see Hyde Park but at least we got a taste of it all. And I don't suppose this is the last such demo we'll ever see...</p>

<h3 id="a005331">tooth fairy fails to show</h3>

<p> Well, we've taken advice from various sources now and Apoa has decided to give the fairy another chance. Unfortunately, her mum has got the tooth somewhere and she's only ever here for the odd moment every day just now. Must remember to get the tooth back and give it another go. Tomorrow Apoa (and the fairy) will have been waiting two weeks to finalise their transaction. Is this a record?</p>

<p>Apoa and Kiloh, on the other hand, have been very busy. They've been hiding in their rooms a lot recently and they were up at 6 this morning to deliver various items including handwritten cards and handmade hanging hearts. Apoa also left a cherry drop with a heart stuck on top of it by each of our beds.</p>

<h3 id="a005329">captain corelli</h3>

<p>Just read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099422042/">Captain Corelli's Mandolin</a>, part of a process of teaching myself to read bigger books (534 pages) and take longer over them (2 months). Obviously, he's a great writer and in the end I thought it was a great book. The main effect it had on me was to make me miserable by getting across a profound sense of the horror of war. The main things that struck me about his writing were how happy he was to digress and enjoy chapters and subplots and so on, regardless of how essential they were to moving the plot along. And, obviously connected, how strong a sense you get of him enjoying his writing. I enjoyed it too, although I had to struggle with the usual impatience that I was reading this book to train myself out of.</p>

<p>I followed the book by watching <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0238112">the film</a> on video. A lot of good things about it, despite the problems of having to reduce 534 pages and all those digressions to something more streamlined. I couldn't understand why they chose to get the actors to perform it in funny accents, though, and I giggled when they had the Italian soldiers singing while shaving rather than singing on the bog.</p>

<p>But I felt cheated by the much-happier-than-the-book ending. For me, this meant removing what was the most powerful thing in the book. I guess it's typical of movie adaptations, but I thought it was a real shame. Maybe they should have gone for a two-part <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0091288">Jean de Florette</a> kind of approach.</p>

<p>And one more thing, both the book and the film fail to raise questions about guilt surrounding the main characters which I would have thought inevitable given what happens in both the book and the film (I'm being inexplicit for the sake of anyone who hasn't seen or read either).</p>

<h3 id="a005328">get off the fence</h3>

<p>I get really fed up with the way arguments get polarised. In the Iraq thing, this means you can only be either for war (gung ho imperialistic swine) or against it (Saddam loving cheese eater).</p>

<p>Timothy Garton Ash wrote <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,889572,00.html">a good article</a> arguing against polarisation and explaining why he's on the fence about Iraq.</p>

<p>It's worth pointing out, though, that the people on one side of this argument are a lot more keen to polarise than the other. According to the US government, and a lot of other pro-war folk, you're either desperate to pull the trigger now and who cares what anyone else thinks or you're 'irrelevant', 'insignificant', 'pathetic' etc. etc. etc. Bush 2 began all this with his 'if you're not with us you're against us' speech - what Chomsky described as the <span class="caps">USA </span>declaring war on the world.</p>

<p>The other thing that strikes me is that the reasons Garton Ash gives against the war are much stronger than the ones he gives for it.</p>

<h2>February 10, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005327">Bush interrupts Oprah</h3>

<p> This came from <a href="http://www.academicsforjustice.org/">Academics for Justice</a>. It's good to hear that on US TV <cite>'the British correspondent said at one point that it was hard to find anyone in Britain <span class="caps">EXCEPT TONY BLAIR </span>that supported the war'</cite> (even though I can think of one or two others)</p>

<p><q>Understanding What Just Happened on The Oprah Winfrey Show </q></p>

<p><q>Today, Oprah Winfrey started a two-part series focusing on the impending <span class="caps">U.S. </span>war on Iraq. About halfway through the show the broadcast was pre-empted by coverage of Pres. George Bush, with Colin Powell at his side, reading a prepared statement on Iraq. The coincidental timing of this pre-emptive press statement raised immediate questions about the motives of the White House war strategists. Students of the Civil Rights Movement will recall an incident in 1964 when activist Fannie Lou Hamer sat before a live television audience and gave a riveting account of the oppression she and other Blacks faced in the South. President Lyndon Johnson was so convinced of the power of her appeal to undermine his own political/racial agenda, that he hastily called a press conference to pull cameras away from Hamer's impassioned revelations. Though the networks pre- empted Hamer's testimony to cover the president, the newscasts later showed her entire presentation.</q> </p>

<p><q>The pre-emption of Winfrey's show today should be seen in the same light. Oprah's audience is a vast and powerful--but largely apolitical--force of middle-class white women. It is likely that most did not watch Colin Powell's live testimony at the <span class="caps">U.N. </span>yesterday. In fact, it is likely that this huge audience was being oriented to the issues of the Iraq war for the first time. Bush and his handlers are also aware that powerful Republican voices, including Rush Limbaugh's, credit Bush's pre-election appearance on the Oprah Show with "turning the tide" in his favor. It is unlikely that they treated this show with anything but intense propaganda interest.</q> </p>

<p> <q>The first 30 minutes of the show was decidedly anti-war and highlighted not only worldwide unanimity in opposition to the war but presented many of the heretofore unheard voices of ordinary people speaking forcefully against Bush's motives. <span class="caps">CNN </span>assisted the Oprah Show by presenting overseas confirmation of this from Great Britain and Iraq. For instance, the British correspondent said at one point that it was hard to find anyone in Britain <span class="caps">EXCEPT TONY BLAIR </span>that supported the war. Other voices repeated their conclusion that the war is "for oil," not "against terrorism." Those familiar with the Bush administration's network cheerleaders at <span class="caps">ABC, NBC, </span>and <span class="caps">CBS </span>would, no doubt, view this expose' with raised eyebrows. Then, without warning or introduction, Bush is seen at the podium reiterating Powell's statement at the <span class="caps">U.N. </span>yesterday! One immediately had to assume that Bush was actually declaring war on Iraq, given the urgency of this interruption. Soon, however, it became clear that <span class="caps">OPRAH </span>herself was the target of this sabre-rattling and not Saddam Hussein. Bush simply summarized Powell's presentation for Oprah's audience, hitting key emotional points for this afternoon women's gathering. He said nothing more of any import at all. Returning to the show, 15 or so minutes later, found still more impassioned, but reasoned, anti-war input from members of Oprah's audience. There was indeed a balance of pro-war input but the net effect of the show--in spite of Bush's strategic Johnsonian interruption--was to embolden the anti-war voices and to make opposition to the war as "patriotic" a position as that of the warmongers. What we just saw was a replay of an old propaganda ploy of an ol' Texas politician, Lyndon Baines Johnson, against the scarecropper's daughter from Mississippi, Fannie Lou Hamer. In 1964, enough of Hamer's message was heard to force Johnson into acting against his own political desires. Bush's ploy in 2003 may have backfired as well.</q></p>

<p>Academics have been worried about plagiarism for a long time. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,890916,00.html">This </a> is going to make it a bit harder to persuade the students that it's not a good idea.

<h3 id="a005322">co inky dinky</h3>

<p> Hanna was just talking about my tooth fairy story and then last night Apoa announced that she too had been experimenting with the tooth fairy.</p>

<p>Both our kids have now tried the experiment of removing a tooth, putting it under the pillow and not telling anyone. </p>

<p>Strangely, the fairy doesn't seem to come under such circumstances.</p>

<p>The latest incident involves Apoa removing a tooth on Saturday and secretly stashing it. After four nights, there's still no sign of the fairy, which Apoa thinks is pretty strong evidence. Being a good scientist, of course, she realises that this is not totally conclusive. But we're not sure what should happen next, especially since the playground is now buzzing with discussion of this latest piece of research....</p>

<h3 id="a005319">this is ... uncool (not)</h3>

<p>Went to see the <a href="http://www.snatzo.com/rezillos/">Rezillos</a> on Saturday night.</p>

<p>I felt like I was in an adaptation of <cite>'The Picture of Dorian Gray'</cite>. They hadn't changed at all, but you should have seen the state of us lot in the audience.</p>

<p>It was great to see men in their forties tumbling upside down onto the stage and into the loving arms of the bouncers.</p>

<p>The gig was over by 10pm so that the venue could be used for a club. So an added irony was for us wrinklies to be heading out of the West End as the youngsters headed in to begin their evening.</p>

<p>The final highlight on the way home was to find the Jeremy Bentham was selling <a href="http://www.ciao.co.uk/reviews/5316904.html">banana bread beer</a> on draft. Yes, it does taste of bananas. Andrew impressed me, as he managed a second pint.</p>

<p>Anyway, the Rezillos are still great and they've even got some new songs. They began the evening with the instruction to <cite>'make noise, not war'</cite> and ended it with <cite>'Somebody's Going To Get Their Head Kicked In Tonight'</cite>. Keep your violence local, that's what I say.</p>

<h3 id="a005318">UK traffic rules</h3>

<p>Just heard this via the London Cycling Campaign. It seems it's now illegal for cars to stop within those green bits with bikes on them at traffic lights (what these 'ASLs' are for is to make sure cyclists are at the front of the queue when waiting at a red light). Also, cyclists now officially have right of way over cars on cycle paths.</p>

<p>It's going to make such a difference, isn't it? (No, me neither)</p>

<p><q>The Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002 come into force on 31 January 2003 replacing the 1994 version. Highlights include making <span class="caps">ASL</span>s fully enforceable - a motor vehicle crossing the first line when the signal is not showing green (unless it's gone to amber and stopping would cause a collision) will be seen as jumping the lights and could be fined or have penalty points imposed. Also s25 gives those on cycle tracks priority expressly for the first time:</q></p>

<p><q>(6) Where the transverse lines [give way markings] are placed in advance of a length of the carriageway of the road where a cycle track crosses the road along a route parallel to the transverse lines, then the requirement shall be that no vehicle shall proceed past such one of those lines as is nearer the cycle track, in a manner or at a time likely to endanger any cyclist proceeding along the cycle track or to cause such a cyclist to change speed or course in order to avoid an accident.</q></p>

<h3 id="a005317">Click Commercial: Ricoh Responds</h3>

<p> (This is a long one)</p>

<p>Remember the <a href="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/billy/permalinker/?pid=571&amp;blog=bi lly ">letter to Ricoh</a> Geoff Pullum copied to <a href="http://www.linguistlist.org"><span class="caps">LINGUIST</span></a> objecting to their advert? </p>

<p>Here's Ricoh's response, and Pullum's response to that:</p>

<p><span class="caps">FROM RICOH</span>:</p>

<p><q>Dear Professor Pullum:</q></p>

<p><q>On behalf of the Ricoh Family Group of companies worldwide, please consider that the advertisement to which you refer in your recent letter was not intended in any way to derogate the Khoisan people or their complex, beautiful language.</q></p>

<p><q>Ricoh, as a culturally sensitive organization, had been assured by our advertising agency that a noted South African anthropologist was employed to advise it during the production of this campaign. The anthropologist, who has worked with this tribe for a number of years, made sure that they were being depicted accurately and in a positive light.</q></p>

<p><q>In the advertisement, Ricoh intended to present Chief Obijol's use of his language as an example of efficient and effective communication, and used the word "simply" to highlight this. While there are many interpretations of the word "simple", we used it to mean "readily understood". We hold simplicity as the gold standard in communication, because, to us, it stands for easy, clear, and effective interaction. The advertisement, part of a campaign entitled "Experts", is intended to highlight and celebrate people who have learned that the most important ideas can be more powerful when shared directly and effectively. We are sorry if you did not take this message away from the advertisement.</q></p>

<p><q>We are alerting our parent company, Ricoh Company, Ltd., the originator of the campaign, of your concerns and your letter. I would like to thank you for taking the initiative to bring this matter to our attention.</q></p>

<p><q>Sincerely,</q></p>

<p><q>Jim Ivy</q></p>

<p><q>cc: The Linguist List, The Economist</q></p>

<p> FROM <span class="caps">GEOFF PULLUM</span>:</p>

<p><q>Dear Jim,</q></p>

<p><q>Thanks for your eloquent letter of January 13. I fully accept your claim that Ricoh meant nothing derogatory. My concern was only that the ad I referred to had inadvertently lent support to an insulting myth.</q></p>

<p><q>The general public does seem eager to believe that at least somewhere in the world there are incredibly primitive people with languages that are almost subhuman in their simplicity (or, else preternaturally complex, as with the hopelessly exaggerated stories about the Eskimos' having hundreds of words for subtly different types of snow). And many sources obligingly supply suitable stories for the credulous.</q></p>

<p><q>Your advertisement brought back to me my experiences in the early 1970s, when I used to advise Norris McWhirter, the editor of The Guinness Book of World Records (it used to be less dumbed down, and included an interesting page of records and superlatives concerning natural languages). Several times over I had to warn Norris off repeating nonsense he had picked up about "primitive languages". In the early 1960s, the book actually had an entry for "Most Primitive Language" (the honor went to Aranda, an Australian Aboriginal language on which in fact there was a well-known literature describing amazing complexities). Then the book picked up something from Time about a primitive language called Taki-Taki (it's more usually called Sranan, and everything Time said about it was wrong, including some nonsense about it having only 300 words).</q></p>

<p><q>I spent hours and hours on correspondence aimed at persuading the editors to keep such insanities out of their book. But when Norris and his brother Ross were invited on a trip to South Africa, they came back with stories of yet another primitive language myth: that the `Bushmen' had a language that was entirely composed of a few dozen clicks and grunts. I had another grass-fire of ignorance to stamp out.</q></p>

<p> <q>Your advertisement's phrase "a series of simple clicking sounds" brought it all back thirty years later! But I am fully prepared to believe you when you say that the implication was completely unintended, and I thank you for your thoughtful letter, and for sharing its content with the many linguists who read The Linguist List.</q></p>

<p> <q>Sincerely,</q></p>

<p> <q>Geoffrey K. Pullum</q></p>

<p> <q>Professor of Linguistics</q></p>

<p> <q>Address to the Unco Guid.</q> <q>My Son, these maxims make a rule, An lump them ay thegither: The Rigid Righteous is a fool, The Rigid Wise anither; The cleanest corn that e'er was dight May hae some pyles o caff in; So ne'er a fellow-creature slight For random fits o daffin.</q></p>

<p><q>O ye, wha are sae guid yoursel, Sae pious and sae holy, Ye've nought to do but mark and tell Your neebours' fauts and folly! Whase life is like a weel-gaun mill, Supplied wi store o water; The heapet happer's ebbing still, An still the clap plays clatter!</q></p>

<p><q>Hear me, ye venerable core, As counsel for poor mortals That frequent pass douce Wisdom's door For glaikit Folly's portals: I for their thoughtless, careless sakes, Would here propone defences - Their donsie tricks, their black mistakes, Their failings and mischances.</q></p>

<p><q>Ye see your state wi theirs compared, And shudder at the niffer; But cast a moment's fair regard, What makes the mighty differ? Discount what scant occasion gave; That purity ye pride in; And (what's aft mair than a' the lave) Your better art o hidin.</q></p>

<p><q>Think, when your castigated pulse Gies now and then a wallop, What ragings must his veins convulse, That still eternal gallop! Wi wind and tide fair i your tail, Right on ye scud your sea-way; But in the teeth o baith to sail, It makes an unco lee-way</q></p>

<p><q>See Social Life and Glee sit down, All joyous and unthinking, Till, quite transmugrify'd, they're grown Debauchery and Drinking: O, would they stay to calculate Th' eternal consequences, Or your more dreaded hell to state - Damnation of expenses!</q></p>

<p><q>Ye high, exalted, virtuous dames, Tied up in godly laces, Before ye gie poor Frailty names, Suppose a change o cases: A dear-lov'd lad, convenience snug, A treach'rous inclination - But, let me whisper in your lug, Ye're aiblins nae temptation.</q></p>

<p><q>Then gently scan your brother man, Still gentler sister woman; Tho they may gang a kennin wrang, To step aside is human: One point must still be greatly dark, The moving Why they do it; And just as lamely can ye mark, How far perhaps they rue it.</q></p>

<p><q>Who made the heart, 'tis He alone Decidedly can try us: He knows each chord, its various tone, Each spring, its various bias: Then at the balance let's be mute, We never can adjust it; What's done we partly may compute, But know not what's resisted.</q></p>

<h3 id="a005309">way to go, wombat</h3>

<p>Holly sent me this:</p>

<p><q>Three US Airforce bases in East Anglia inspected in a month</q></p>

<p><q>Weapons Inspectors arrested at <span class="caps">RAF</span> Feltwell</q></p>

<p><q>At 16:30 on Friday 10th January, a delegation of 5 weapons inspectors from Cambridge Students Against the War entered <span class="caps">RAF</span> Feltwell, to confirm reports that the base forms part of a US Weapons of Mass Destruction development programme. Amongst other concerns, the inspectors believe the base is assisting in target acquisition for the expected US attacks on Iraq.</q></p>

<p><q>Inspectors entered through the main gate, much to the surprise of the guards, and continued into the base, collecting evidence of activities carried out on the site. The watching US soldiers were powerless to do anything but close the gates to the most sensitive areas and await the military police. Hindered in their progress, the inspectors asked to speak to the <span class="caps">RAF </span>personnel nominally in charge of the installation, but it turned out to be entirely in American hands. They then demanded that the base commander and his family be removed from the country for questioning.</q></p>

<p><q>However, authorities at the base failed to comply with requests for cooperation and the weapons inspectors were arrested as they left the site. The 4 person support team was then arrested across the road from the main entrance and a vehicle was impounded. All were taken to police stations in Norfolk and Suffolk and released without charge 6- 8 hours later. One was ordered to report back to the station in the next few days.</q> </p>

<p><q>A total of three East Anglian US Airforce bases (Feltwell, Lakenheath, and Mildenhall) have now been inspected within the last month - apart from anything else revealing an astonishing lack of security at bases storing weaponry including suspected nuclear weapons. Interviewed after his release, inspector 'Spikey' said, 'Unfortunately, all our findings confirm local fears that East Anglia is being conscripted into US military programmes without any democratic discussion or accountability. The presence of nuclear weapons is not only illegal and immoral, it also makes this area a potential target for enemies of the <span class="caps">US.'</span></q> </p>

<p><q>The base at Feltwell is run by the US Air Force as part of a network of 'near-space tracking facilities'. These tracking facilities are part of US attempts to militarise space. Details of these <span class="caps">USAF </span>plans can be found on their website <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/jv2020/">here</a> . The plan - known as 'Vision 2020' - states that 'space forces will emerge to protect military and commercial interests and investment in the space medium...' Feltwell also plays an important role as an electronic warfare and surveillance site - surveillance equipment at Feltwell is used as part of an ongoing US National Security Agency effort to monitor commercial, personal, and military electronic communications (phone, email, and radio) worldwide - for more information, see the Guardian story <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/europarl/Story/0,2763,498440,00.html"> here</a></q> </p>

<p><q><span class="caps">RAF</span> Lakenheath is the largest US Air Force-operated base in England, and the most important tactical nuclear bombing base in Europe. The 48th Fighter Wing at Lakenheath is the US Air Force in Europe's only F-15 Fighter Wing. It has a long history of use in the Gulf, being the first F-111 fighter unit to deploy in the First Gulf War in 1991, and was involved in bombing in 1998 and since. <span class="caps">NATO </span>and <span class="caps">U.S. </span>leaders have asserted that if America is needed again in this region, the 48th Fighter Wing will be called out first (see <a href="http://www.lakenheath.af.mil/Mission- history/index.html">here</a>)</q> </p>

<p><q><span class="caps">RAF</span> Mildenhall, just 20 miles from Cambridge, is a staging post for US flights to Europe. This includes the nuclear weapons based in Europe under the <span class="caps">NATO </span>nuclear sharing agreement. The US Air Force runs aerial refuelling, special operations, air mobility, reconnaissance and intelligence out of <span class="caps">RAF</span> Mildenhall. The base's website asserts that <span class="caps">RAF</span> Mildenhall is used by the US Air Force to provide 'global power and global reach. Anytime. Anywhere.'.</q> </p>

<p><q>Both Lakenheath and Mildenhall are seeing massive increases in air traffic as <span class="caps">USAF </span>transport, bomber, and fighter aircraft are funnelled towards their deployment in the Persian Gulf region ready for attacks on Iraq.</q> </p>

<p><q>CamSAW supporter Nick Gill, hearing the news of the inspections, said, 'The weapons inspectors should be commended for seeking to apply the same standards to the East Anglian air bases as are currently being applied in Iraq. In the event of war on Iraq, the so- called <span class="caps">RAF </span>bases will be used to inflict horrendous casualties on the innocent people of Iraq. This cannot be allowed to happen.'</q> </p>

<p><q>Asked about the value of such actions, inspector 'Wombat' said, 'While these inspections were planned with a sense of humour, they send a signal that the anti-war movement is absolutely serious about opposing this unjustifiable war. People all over the country are organising demonstrations, vigils, die-ins, sit-downs, base incursions, and much more. We will not have Iraq destroyed in our names. These actions are just the beginning.'</q> </p>

<p><q>24 MPs have signed an Early Day Motion supporting the Lakenheath inspection on 12th December. The text and signatories can be seen <a href="http://edm.ais.co.uk/weblink/html/motion.html/ref=435 ">here</a></q></p>

<p><q>Cambridge Students Against the War (CamSAW) was founded as a response to <span class="caps">USA'</span>s 'war on terror' and attack on Afghanistan in 2001. With another unjustified war imminent, this coalition of students from Cambridge University, Anglia Polytechnic University and local higher education and sixth form colleges is continuing to plan actions. More information and some photos can be found at www.camsaw.org.uk </q></p>

<h3 id="a005308">fine things to be seen</h3>

<p>I used to live right next to it but fifteen years later I finally made it to <a href="http://www.kensalgreen.co.uk/">Kensal Green Cemetery</a> yesterday. I went with some fairly literary people but there was something here for everyone, creeping around the catacombs with a torch to look at the decaying coffins of outrageous earls, starfucking (we took in Brunel, Thackeray, Birkbeck and a couple of royals among others yesterday), manmade and natural symbolism, engineering (dig the recently renovated hydraulic pump which lowers the catafalque in silence at a rate of one inch per hefty pump), lessons on economics, theft and vandalism. You name it, really.</p>

<p>The scariest moment was when we looked at the monument whose pillars have turned to dust. They've fenced it off with a sign saying <cite>'Beware - Keep Out'</cite> which translates into child language as <cite>'Climb Over Here - Unless You're A Great Big Chicken'</cite>.</p>

<p>Our guide couldn't resist scraping a bit of dust away from one of the pillars. They should really just knock it down now rather than leaving it up to the monument to decide. Maybe they could charge admission and make a few bob at the same time.</p>

<h3 id="a005304">an open letter</h3>

<p> Geoff Pullum just told <a href="http://linguistlist.org/"><span class="caps">LINGUIST</span></a> about this letter he sent to Ricoh:</p>

<p><q>December 30, 2002</q></p>

<p><q>Dear Mr Ivy,</q></p>

<p><q>The Ricoh Corporation's advertisement on page 2 of The Economist Technology Quarterly [insert following page 48 of The Economist, Dec. 14--20, 2002] shows a picture of a Khoi tribal leader named Chief Obijol. The legend reads:</q></p>

<p><q>'With a series of simple clicking sounds, he can teach a force of 200 men to hunt, to treat an illness, even how to find an appropriate mate.'</q></p>

<p><q>This is not the first time I have read racist nonsense about the hunters of the Kalahari desert just clicking and grunting at each other rather than using a proper language with sentences like the rest of us. Your corporation and its advertising agency should be ashamed of repeating such stupidness.</q></p>

<p><q>The ad makes an unobjectionable point: for explaining traditions and skills to a couple of hundred people in the face-to-face context of a hunter-gatherer tribe, oral communication in a human language 'works exceedingly well,' it says; but for the kind of communication involved in running a large modern business one needs document and image sharing of the sort Ricoh offers. The trouble is all with the unnecessarily demeaning and offensive way the first part is put. It makes Khoi-speaking people sound more like exotic animals than like human beings speaking a human language.</q></p>

<p><q>The Khoi people of Southwestern Africa do not communicate in 'a series of simple clicking sounds.' Their languages are ordinary human languages with the same kinds of complexities as are found in English grammar. It's true that Khoi languages have velaric suction consonants that are informally described as sounding like clicks, but they are merely consonants, and they occur with vowels and more ordinary non-click consonants in syllables, words, phrases, and sentences as in any other human language. To refer to Chief Obijol's speech as 'a series of simple clicking sounds' is as stupid as calling your own speech 'a series of simple uh sounds.'</q></p>

<p><q>I will be sharing this letter with the 16,500 linguists who subscribe to The Linguist List as well as the editor of The Economist. I very much hope you will share it with the people at your advertising agency who did this to you.</q></p>

<p><q>Sincerely,</q></p>

<p><q>Geoffrey K. Pullum</q> <q>Professor of Linguistics</q></p>

<h3 id="a005295">more on apostrophes</h3>

<p>Jed writes:</p>

<p><q>Billy!</q></p>

<p><q>I just read your blog on apostrophes and wondered if you are interested in my apostrophe story: A million years ago when I was making TV Commercials with <span class="caps">D.A.P</span>ennebaker (he of 'Primary' and 'Woodstock' then and 'Startup.com' now) I also helped Penne in the closing post production on his film of Bob Dylans English tour. I designed the poster (now a collector's item - and No, I don't have a copy) and took his title 'Don't Look Back' and did an all caps title that became 'DONT <span class="caps">LOOK BACK'.</span> We had a lot of talk about it ( and I have some current emails from Penne discussing it again) and when it came out Safire of The New York Times went ballistic - never mind the movie, he wrote a whole column blasting the movie just for that missing apostrophe. I was quoted by Penne as saying something like 'Well, we wanted to be controversial' (which I'm sure I never said!). But today, all over the world that movie and my poster are still working together quite well without the aid of that apostrophe.</q></p>

<p><q>Cheers</q></p>

<p><q>jed</q></p>

<p>ps. did you notice the apostrophe he missed out on this message too? ;-)</p>

<h3 id="a005294">back for now</h3>

<p>Well, I'm back in London after a most enjoyable trip to Scotland to see Bessie and Ted and everyone. The kids particularly enjoyed seeing their Scottish cousins. Another highlight was not having millions of reasons to jump out of bed every day and run around like headless chickens until we use up our energy supplies. I'm trying hard not to get straight back into the old ways now that we're back.</p>

<p>Today is Kiloh's birthday so we've had a house full of e-kara and have just seen <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0167261">The Two Towers</a> followed by a pizza. The movie was an improvement on the first one, partly because it had something more like an ending, but I got bored for the first chunk of it as one fight followed another and everyone took turns at being presumed dead and then turning out to be alive after all.</p>

<p>Pizza Express was fun, reminiscing about the (alleged) previous bigger size of the pizzas and hoping the kids weren't going to get us thrown out. I took care to make sure Kiloh didn't cut her finger off while cutting the cake, and so managed to get her to cut me instead (not too badly or anything).</p>

Three days in a hotel room with the smell of cat wee is not my idea of a nice change. Luckily, I have discovered the antidote.</p>

<p>Why can't she just learn to talk about things like other people?</p>

<h3 id="a005292">I'm not dead</h3>

<p> I'm just busy.</p>

<p>This is 'audit-culture-gone-mad' week for me. I'm off to external a linguistics department while another group of academics are doing the same to us (by post). Today, another committee is looking at an application we put in to them. Meanwhile, Robbie just sent us a beautiful Christmas card informing us that 'Santa fails the audit'. I think it's Santa's wife they should keep an eye on. I don't think I can stand another discussion of the story of whether or not the story we're discussing is a story - has academia taken over the media or something?</p>

<h3 id="a005291">Sapir-Whorf For The Day</h3>

<p>Thought I was dreaming yesterday morning when some religious geezer was giving us his <cite>'thought for the day'</cite> on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/">Today</a> programme (they won't let you talk unless you're a religious geezer, which is quite a phenomenon in itself, imho). Anyway, he was giving us a hardline version of the <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/journal/worldtour99/sapirwhorf.html">Sapir-Whorf hypothesis</a>. He went as far as to say something like that if you say <cite>'he walked through the mud'</cite> to a Spanish person he'd think about where the walker was going while if you said it to an English speaker they'd think about what it felt like to be walking through mud. This being because <cite>'English is a dynamic language'</cite>. Maybe I <span class="caps">WAS </span>dreaming...</p>

<h3 id="a005290">a modest proposal</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.zmag.org">ZNet</a> just sent me a modest proposal from Chomsky which seems not to be up on their site yet but will be soon, I guess. I'll tell you when it is but in the meantime, here's the basic idea:</p>

<p><q>One simple plan seems to have been ignored, perhaps because it would be regarded as insane, and rightly so. But it is instructive to ask why.</q></p>

<p><q>The modest proposal is for the United States to encourage Iran to invade Iraq, providing the Iranians with the necessary logistical and military support, from a safe distance (missiles, bombs, bases, etc.).</q></p>

<p><q>As a proxy, one pole of "the axis of evil" would take on another.</q></p>

<p>Chomsky is talking at the Institute of Education in London on the 10th of December, btw. Tickets are 10 quid and details are at <a href="http://www.redpepper.org.uk/xbullet.html">Red Pepper</a></p>

<h3 id="a005289">you say tomato's...</h3>

<p>Enjoyed listening to Lynne Truss this morning on a programme called <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cgi- perl/whatson/prog_parse.cgi?FILENAME=20021203/20021203_0930_49700_1588 _15">Cutting A Dash</a> where she revealed how seriously she takes punctuation.</p>

<p>It was all about the endangered apostrophe and the vigilante groups who are out to protect it, using marker pens to add apostrophes that have been missed and sticking stickers on apostrophes that shouldn't be there. (One guy on the show was also a member of <cite>'pipe down'</cite>, a group who stick protest stickers in restaurants with muzak).</p>

<p>They had David Denison, a linguist from Manchester University, on explaining why people find it so hard to get the rules right, and also suggesting that the existence of 'greengrocer's apostrophe' errors is evidence that apostrophes are on the way to extinction.</p>

<p>Personally, I'm on the side of the exterminators even though I have some sympathy for the people who report that they feel physical pain when they see apostrophes misused.</p>

<h3 id="a005285">take the skinheads bowling</h3>

<p> Remember <a href="http://www.campervanbeethoven.com/">Camper Van Beethoven</a>? <cite>'Take the skinheads bowling'</cite> is the blindingly obvious choice as opening number in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0310793">Bowling For Columbine</a>. It's blindingly obvious and it's low budget (sound quality really pretty poor) but still great to hear it again. And that pretty much sums up the movie too. The question it asked was: what is it about Americans that makes them go around killing each other? The big surprise for me was that the answer isn't just that there are too many guns. (Canada being the big counterexample). I still think you can't shoot someone if you haven't got a gun, though.</p>

<p>Anyway, I enjoyed the film while feeling guilty about enjoying something that's reminding me how bad things are. I felt guilty again the next day taking the kids to see Pierce Brosnan and co playing with guns and things.</p>

<p>What's the world coming to when seven year olds are so media savvy that they go in knowing about the film's classification as containing <cite>'moderate action, violence and one sex scene'</cite> and then object when they see Pierce getting horny with Rosamund Pike after already having <cite>'sexed'</cite> (that's the word they use for it) Halle Berry?</p>

<p>They know about the classification because the Odeon emailed us this message:</p>

<p><q>The certificate for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is confirmed as 12A. However, the correct certificate addendum is in fact, "contains intense combat and fantasy horror scenes". It is <span class="caps">NOT, </span>"contains moderate action, violence and one sex scene" which was attached by mistake. This is in fact the correct certificate addendum for James Bond: Die Another Day.</q></p>

<h3 id="a005284">Jamie is Mr. Chips</h3>

<p>I guess all teachers have fantasy students, don't they? And I guess we'd all pick the same dream students. I mean, Eminem and John Lydon would be on anybody's list, wouldn't they? And the scariest thought in the world would be to have Billy Bragg show up in your seminar (only joking, of course).</p>

<p>But do people make lists of teachers manques? (Sorry, dunno how to do the acute accent).</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm one of the few who never got bored of <a href="http://www.jamieoliver.net/">Jamie Oliver</a>. I even took the <cite>'mullarkey'</cite> phase in my stride. I'm enjoying the fact that he's managed to keep making must-see programmes after all these years.</p>

<p>The main interest for me is discovering what a good teacher he is. I mean, I knew he was a good communicator in general, but I'm really impressed by how he deals with his 'problem students' (and by the patience and goodwill of the teachers at the catering college). The one mistake I think he's made is hopping into a car after some of his hardest one-to-ones with Nicola or Kerry-Anne or Michael and telling five and a half million people what he was really thinking.</p>

<p>The play was called <cite>Anton in Eastbourne</cite> and was about Chekhov checking into a hotel in Eastbourne.

<p>Peter Tinniswood is a bit of a god among radio dramatists, and his work is always inventive linguistically as well as in other ways.

<h3 id="a005277">going through the motions</h3>

<p>Sadly, I might be the only person left who didn't see Buffy's famous <a href="http://www.upn.com/shows/buffy/episodes/season06/show_07.shtml"> musical episode</a>. Luckily, this meant I was in for a treat yesterday.</p>

<p>After the massage Ohna treated me to, where I not only got my back a good seeing to but also found out more than anyone needs to about building and racing bicycles and motorbikes, including a few tips for motorbike pursuits (<a href="http://www.alfiecox.co.za/">Alfie Cox</a> for a groovy biking holiday in South Africa, <a href="http://www.adventure-motorcycling.com/mcy/mcy04.htm">Si Pavey</a> in this country, <cite>'a wet weekend in Wales won't prepare you for Dakar'</cite>) and the shocking news that they have traffic cops specifically out to catch speeding cyclists in Richmond Park (speed limit is 17mph), and after a visit to <a href="http://www.ivormairants.co.uk/">Ivor Mairants</a> where I got to play for as long as I liked with some extremely beautiful guitars by Amalio Burguet, Manuel Rodriguez and others, I visited the getting-ever-more-popular cafe in the basement of Virgin, which now has listening posts and really old computer games like Galaxians and stuff on the tables. I've always been a fan of the Virgin cafe, which used to be upstairs and next door. The new version is pretty ugly as an environment but I enjoy the functions.</p>

<p>Anyway, imagine my delight as I found a listening post with the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000070WPE/qid=1037786022/">soundtrack</a> to the Buffy musical episode (aka <cite>Once More With Feeling</cite>) and got to discover what all the fuss is about.</p>

<p>It made me wonder whether there's anyone left out there who still thinks that the nation with the most well-developed sense of irony on the planet doesn't get irony. (I mean people who really think it rather than just people who say it ironically). I have heard a theory that presidential election results are affected by people who just can't resist voting for the most absurd candidate, as their sense of humour makes them forget how serious the consequences can be...</p>

<h2>November 13, 2002</h2>


<h3 id="a005275">the new rosetta</h3>

<p>Just found out about the <a href="http://www.rosettaproject.org:8080/live">Rosetta Project</a> via <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,54345,00.html">this wired article</a>. The Rosetta project is an open-source collaborative project with the aim of creating a modern Rosetta stone (in this case a 3-inch nickel disk) archiving 1,400 of the 7,000 (who counted, btw? and how?) world languages.</p>

<p>Reading about it also led me to <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/"><span class="caps">OLAC</span></a> which is:</p>

<p><q>'an international partnership of institutions and individuals who are creating a worldwide virtual library of language resources by: (i) developing consensus on best current practice for the digital archiving of language resources, and (ii) developing a network of interoperating repositories and services for housing and accessing such resources.'</q></p>

<p>All this collaborative, open-source grooviness. And the joy of following one interesting link to another. It's like some kind of 'world-wide-web' or something. How long until it all gets spoiled by commercialism and we end up with pop-ups all over the place?</p>

<h3 id="a005274">social research projects</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/tennisgirl.gif" alt="social research project" width="116" height="155" border="0" /></p>

<p>Went back to the <a href="http://www.instituteofvisualculture.org">Institute of Visual Culture</a> yesterday with Alan and some students.</p>

<p>I was quite impressed with my stamina, having only slept for two and a half hours the night before. It was an enjoyable day. It began with a traditional one hour wait before the third of the timetabled trains decided it could be bothered to go to Cambridge. Before going to the gallery, we strolled through Cambridge and Alan explained some stuff about the town and the university and everything. Luckily, none of the students decided to transfer.</p>

<p>The exhibition was <a href="http://www.instituteofvisualculture.org/022_present.php">'Cognition Control'</a>, a collection of work by Stephen Willats and a few others. The work on show was from the 60s and 70s and, as they say, it:</p>

<p><q>'represents a vital period in British art, when Willats and his colleagues proposed activating the audience as an integral factor in the conceptual formation of a more open-ended and inclusive art practice. Each of these projects shares a common objective to use visual arts practice as a tool for social enquiry and transformation. Their radical intervention in the cultural infrastructure of the time still resonates with, and influences, many artists working today.'</q></p>

<p>Part of the idea was to break down barriers between art and science/academia, partly by carrying out research projects that ignored the usual conventions.</p>

<p>The exhibition was a bit perplexing, partly because it's hard to leap back through the decades and imagine what it would have been like then, and especially to feel confident that you understand what they were trying to do. Was it ironic? sincere? incoherent? incompetent? Were they poking fun at scientists/academics? Or what?</p>

<p>Luckily, Stefan, the director of the institute, was there to discuss it all and I enjoyed listening to Alan and Stefan discussing it all.</p>

<p>I like the idea of using the world and the people in it as the materials for your art. And it was interesting to look at similarities and differences between this work and some of the work that goes on now. Stephen Willats hadn't really bothered to keep track of his work, catalogue it or anything. There aren't many artists around now, who would be so relaxed about what they do.</p>

<p>One thing it got us thinking about was hippiedom and the extent to which remnants of that survive. One of our students grew up in a series of communes. Are there any communes still around?</p>

<h3 id="a005269">godspeed</h3>

<p>I don't know anyone who isn't a fan of Godspeed You! Black Emperor.</p>

<p>I'm pleased to read <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,836839,00.html">here</a> that they've sountracked <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0289043">28 Days Later</a> but I'm confused and ashamed that I wasn't aware that they'd moved the exclamation mark. When did I fall out of the loop?</p>

<p>So <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/11/07/iraq.resolution/index.html">it seems</a> the UN resolution finally came down to whether to use <cite>'and</cite> or <cite>'or'</cite>.</p>

<h3 id="a005266">profanity</h3>

<p> John thought Joseph's language might be too rude for me. Ha! I thought. I'm not scared of three year old toilet humour!</p>

<p>Then I got an email from the machines at the place where one of my students works telling me that my email (I sent them the text of the Simon Hoggart piece) <cite>'contained profanity'</cite> and that it was in quarantine pending deletion in 30 days. I thought quarantine was something you got let out of after a while when they thought you were safe? So inhumane. As my student quipped when I told her:</p>

<p><q>Ha Ha!</q> <q>Our IT department will be happy with you. Ha ha!</q></p>

<p>Whatever happened to deference? I'm sure they never spoke to Mr. Chips this way ;-)</p>

<h3 id="a005264">grammar for writing</h3>

<p>Have a look <a href="http://www.lang.ltsn.ac.uk/lings/linggrammar.html">here</a> if you're interested in the ongoing debate about grammar teaching in schools. I'm off to spend the afternoon discussing this along with questions about linguistics in education more generally. One particular question we'll be discussing is whether grammar teaching can help kids with their writing. What do you think?</p>

<p>Top <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardianpolitics/story/0,3605,834385,0 0.html">piece</a> by Simon Hoggart today. It's hard to pick one bit to quote at you cos it's all so funny. But here's one little extract:</p>

<p><q>Another [Tory MP] said, 'That bastard was the most disloyal bastard of all the bastards John Major had to cope with. And do you know why? Because he's a bastard!'</q></p>

<h3 id="a005262">the town that was lost at sea</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.jobbles.demon.co.uk/">Jed</a> drew my attention to this seriously depressing <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/story.jsp?story=347861">article</a> about the drug problem in Fraserburgh. My mum and sister live just along the coast from <cite>'The Broch'</cite>, as the locals call it, and my niece is in Fraserburgh hospital with her new baby boy as I write. I knew things were bad there, but one misjudgement I'd made was to infer that things were bad everywhere rather than that Fraserburgh was particularly bad. It doesn't make the situation any worse but it somehow makes me feel worse about it.</p>

<p>By the way, does anyone know how many 'drug capitals' various countries have? Scotland, Britain and Europe all seem to have quite a few. Is it that the charts keep changing or is it that there is more than one chart?</p>

<h3 id="a005261">Bob the Builder meets the real world</h3>

<p>Today, Apoa and Kiloh spontaneously adapted the lyrics to 'Bob The Builder' to make reference to two builders they know.</p>

<p>Original lyrics are:</p>

<p><q>Bob the Builder</q> <q>Can he fix it?</q> <q>Bob the Builder</q> <q>Yes! He! Can!</q></p>

<p>Apoa's new lyrics were:</p>

<p><q>Fred the Builder</q> <q>Can he fix it?</q> <q>Fred the Builder</q> <q>May! Ay! Be!</q></p>

<p>Kiloh's new lyrics were:</p>

<p><q>John the Builder</q> <q>Can he fix it?</q> <q>John the builder</q> <q>He hardly! Ever! Comes!</q></p>

<h3 id="a005258">Gore Vidal</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.otherlanguages.org">Mark</a> writes:</p>

<p><q>Dear Billy,</q></p>

<p><q>I enjoyed the paragraph where you cycle locally but worry globally - interesting to see Gore Vidal is on the case with September 11th.</q></p>

<p><q>That there were plans to bomb Afghanistan before then is fairly clear now, but if he can prove that extra claim the administration sat on its hands as the hijackers approached, that would be serious for Americans, wouldn't it? Making Bush into a sort of SuperNixon.</q></p>

<p><q>I can imagine Vidal alone might have the connections and tenacity to follow that one through, terrier-like, all the way down the tunnel. Since I'm in exile, I can't buy that Observer - did you get that issue to read his full claims?</q></p>

<p><q>Cheers, Mark</q></p>

<p>I did read the article but I didn't keep it. I wonder if <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com">dug</a> kept a copy?</p>

<h3 id="a005257">toffee apples are SO delicious!</h3>

<p> The kids did notice more than the sweets. On the way to school this morning, I listened to ten minutes on the delights of the Nicholas Nickleby (our local pub) and all the other sweets they scored. Then they moved on to eggs and things. Kiloh told Aidan that <cite>'some people were kicking old men all over the place!'</cite></p>

<p>I'm just off to Tottenham to do some work and I've heard that in <a href=" http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardianpolitics/story/0,3605,823744,00.html ">today's speech</a> Gordon Brown (our chancellor, i.e. the guy who spends our money for us) will be picking on Tottenham as a place with over 3,000 unemployed people even though there are jobs in other bits of London they could do. Why doesn't he send them all to University? I've heard there are some good ones in London full of teachers sitting around just waiting for someone to teach.</p>

<h3 id="a005255">urban halloween</h3>

<p>So, if you ask the kids I was with tonight what halloweeen was like, they'll tell you it was fun and that they scored loads of sweets.</p>

<p>If you ask the grownups, they'll also tell you it was fun. But they might also mention that three houses they visited had had eggs chucked at their front door, that two pumpkins on the doorstep of Jessie's house were smashed to bits (Jessie and the other kids who live there will tell you how <cite>'two of our pumpkins <span class="caps">EXPLODED</span>!'</cite>), that they watched five guys kicking the shit out of someone and when they checked it out they found the five guys were workmen and that the other guy had been trying to steal stuff off of their van (a 'pick-up' kind of thing so you could just take stuff off the top without any 'breaking and entering'), that when we were in the local pub (the kids trick-or-treated the pub and found tables of sweets there waiting for them) they heard the same guys boasting about how enjoyable it was to feel their feet connect with the thief's face, that they saw a woman walking down the street talking to her mobile in tears while a kid from the gang who had traumatised her followed her asking <cite>'are you all right?'</cite> while his mates yelled after him to <cite>'fucking come back here, you fucking idiot!'</cite> (none of these kids could have been over 12 years old), and so on. Rashomon!</p>

<p>Reminds me of the moment at woodcraft when we sent the kids into a patch of woodland (left there by a <span class="caps">WWII </span>bomb) to find green sticks for marshmallows and the leader of the session had to explain to the naive 6-9 year old kids that they might find things there that they should <cite>'NOT <span class="caps">TOUCH</span>!'</cite>, i.e. condoms and syringes.</p>

<h3 id="a005253">but seriously</h3>

<p>Peter's bored with hearing about my bikes. Does he think I'm running this blog as some kind of public service? Anyway, here are some links just for him.</p>

<p>Find out <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/op-ed/20021029- 26892395.htm">here</a> what gas the Russians used, as well as about a more efficient alternative the US has developed.</p>

<p>Read <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,819931,0 0.html">here</a> about another fascinating Gore Vidal essay, suggesting that Bush and his mates allowed the towers to be hit as a pretext to carry out an existing plan to attack Afghanistan. The full article's not on the web, though.</p>

<p>And if you want to worry about whether Osama's got nukes, try <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/world/20021028- 9543907.htm">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a005248">on the road again (soon)</h3>

<p> Just heard from <a href="http://www.cyclesurgery.com">Cycle Surgery</a>. They've heard back from Trek who say that a new frame will be too much bother, seeing as how my bike was made back in the days when the Starship Enterprise was still considered fairly modern. So they want to give me a whole one of these instead:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/trek800.jpg" alt="also in silver" width="400" height="240" border="0" /></p>

<p>Now I just need to pick up an old frame, shove all the bits that I've got in the garden shed onto it, and we'll become an 8-bike family (yes, I know there are only 4 of us - sad, isn't it?).</p>

<h3 id="a005245">words of the day</h3>

<p><a href="http://ccms.ntu.edu.tw/~karchung/index.htm">Karen Chung</a> is a regular contributor of useful links to <a href="http://www.linguistlist.org"><span class="caps">LINGUIST</span></a>. Here is her latest posting:</p>

<p><q>I expect lots of us are subscribed to Anu Garg's 'A Word A Day' - considering his circulation of over 300,000. I've been aware for some time, though, that there are other 'Word of the Day' sites and services, and thought I'd do a Google search and put some of the links on my site for my students, to add some interactivity.</q></p>

<p><q>I was a bit amazed to find just how <strong>many</strong> 'Word of the Day's there are out there, and the sheer variety! There are 'Word of the Day's for all different levels of English proficiency for one thing - but even more intriguing were the non-English ones I found. There are the more pedestrian 'Wort des Tages' and 'Mot du Jour' and ones for other well-studied European languages, to be sure, but also daily words in numerous <strong>native American</strong> languages, with Alaska and Hawaii especially well represented! Many include sound files. There are also a 'medical' word of the day, and a bilingual one for Chinese civil law! I'm not sure how conscientious each Webmaster is about updating their material, but I did choose what looked like the best of the sites I visited.</q></p>

<p><q>The 21 'Word of the Day' links are available at: <a href="http://ccms.ntu.edu.tw/~karchung/Extras.htm">http://ccms.ntu.edu ..tw/~karchung/Extras.htm</a></q></p>

<p><q>- just click on 'Words of the Day' in the index at the top of the page.</q></p>

<p><q>Please write and tell me if you know of other 'Word of the Day' sites you think should be included.</q></p>

<p><q>Also of possible interest are the 'Language and Linguistics' links at: <a href="http://ccms.ntu.edu.tw/~karchung/linguistics.htm">http://ccms.nt u.edu.tw/~karchung/linguistics.htm</a></q></p>

<h3 id="a005241">you say Lie-Chester, I say Lester...</h3>

<p> Interesting discussion of placenames at the <a href="http://languagehat.blogspot.com/">languagehat</a>. Should we really change from Peking to Beijing just because trhe Chinese government ask us to? Apparently, 'Beijing' is closer to the Mandarin pronunciation than 'Peking' but both are pretty far from 'Pak-king' which is the Cantonese, i.e. equally Chinese, way of saying it.</p>

<p>Reminds me of the great <a href="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/billy/permalinker/?pid=165&amp;blog =billy">HimALayas debate</a></p>

<p>Yes, my bike died today. After twelve years of loyal and trusty service, the frame broke on my way to work this morning. B-(</p>

<p>But now the good news. Trek frames come with a 'limited lifetime guarantee'. This means they'll replace it with the nearest contemporary equivalent if you are the original owner and have the receipt. And guess what? Ohna just found the receipt. So this evening I will be mostly collecting my bike and stripping it down before visiting <a href="http://www.cyclesurgery.com/">Cycle Surgery</a> tomorrow am.</p>

<p>Even better news. Sylvia is going to lend me a bike until the new frame comes through. Ah, the camaraderie of the road.</p>

<h3 id="a005230">time to leave home</h3>

<p>Kiloh decided she'd had enough today and tried to leave home. The first time she's thought of this. She stormed out of the kitchen and headed for the door with 'her bag' on her back. The bag was clearly symbolic since she picked up Ohna's bag which happened to be in the lobby. I hope the whole act was symbolic, although she proceeded to torture Apoa when they were in bed by constantly talking about how she plans to escape during the night...</p>

<h3 id="a005225">The Deeper Meaning of Babbling</h3>

<p> Karen Chung just posted this on <a href="http://www.linguistlist.org"><span class="caps">LINGUIST</span></a>:</p>

<p><q>The October 1, 2002 online edition of the <em>New York Times</em> has an article entitled "Seeking Deeper Meaning in the Babbling of Babies". A few sample paragraphs:</q></p>

<p><q>An 11-month-old baby, her face spattered with food and her lips wet with drool, pushes her chin toward the camera and says, "Da da da da da" in a soft singsong voice. A few seconds later, though, the picture freezes and a small grid appears, superimposed over the baby's mouth. Look carefully and the lines enable you to see that as the baby babbles, her mouth opens wider on the right side than on the left. Suddenly, what was merely cute becomes scientifically interesting. If the baby babbles mainly on the right, the researchers say, it means that babbling is a form of language. ...But many experts argue that language is not hard-wired into the brain. Babies are not born with language, these scientists say, but rather learn language as they grow, making use of the brain's capacity for complex tasks, the tongue's ability to articulate and the instinct for socialization. Through imitation and practice, they learn to speak and understand the language they hear.</q></p>

<h3 id="a005223">translations</h3>

<p>Thanks, John, for pointing me to <a href="http://chronicle.com/free/v49/i05/05b00701.htm">this article</a> about translations by Wendy Lesser. Among other thing, it compares Alfred Birnbaum's translations of Haruki Murakami with Jay Rubin's versions. Here's Jay Rubin's version of the beginning of <cite>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</cite>, which is also the first story in <cite>The Elephant Vanishes</cite>:</p>

<p><q>When the phone rang, I was in the kitchen, boiling a potful of spaghetti and whistling along with an FM broadcast of the overture to Rossini's 'The Thieving Magpie', which has to be the perfect music for cooking pasta.</q></p>

<p><q>I wanted to ignore the phone, not only because the spaghetti was nearly done, but because Claudio Abbado was bringing the London Symphony to its musical climax.</q></p>

<p>And here's Alfred Birnbaum's version:</p>

<p><q>I'm in the kitchen cooking spaghetti when the woman calls. Another moment until the spaghetti is done; there I am, whistling the prelude to Rossini's 'La Gazza Ladra' along with the FM radio. Perfect spaghetti-cooking music.</q></p>

<p><q>I hear the telephone ring but tell myself, Ignore it. Let the spaghetti finish cooking. It's almost done, and besides, Claudio Abbado and the London Symphony Orchestra are coming to a crescendo.</q></p>

<p>Which do you prefer? John and I have talked before about Murakami's language and wondered how much is determined by the translator. It's interesting to have parallel texts to compare. Like Wendy Lesser, I prefer Birnbaum but I'm not sure it's for the same reasons as her.</p>

<p>btw, if you haven't read any of Haruki Murakami's work, you should. <cite>The Elephant Vanishes</cite> is a good place to start (it's where I started after John gave me a copy).</p>

<h3 id="a005222">lemonade 5 cents</h3>

<p> At last it happened. The kids realised the potential of our little bit of wasted ground at the front of the house. Oisin started the idea. He gathered up some bunches of dead dried flowers and set up a stall selling 'bouquets' for 20 pence. The other kids joined in by making bouquets from the weeds growing between the concrete. Soon every passer-by was being accosted. Actually, they didn't even wait to be passed by - they were yelling up and down the street and even trying to stop passing cyclists. In about an hour they made 2 pounds 65. Hope they don't follow Ohna's example - apparently she used to gather up lots of her mum's things and try to sell them.</p>

<p>(They're giving the money to 'Action For Kids', btw - Kiloh's favourite charity).</p>

There are some beauties here, but I have to say one of my scientific heroes, who I read about in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0712308849/">this book</a> is the guy who discovered that <cite>helicobacter pylori</cite> (say it a few times - go on, it's fun) contributes to ulcerous stomach problems. No-one believed him so he took a scrape of bacteria from the inside of a sufferer's stomach, cultivated it in a petrie/petrey dish (not sure how to spell this) and then swallowed it. He got symptoms within a week and then cured himself with antibiotics.</p>

<p>What a guy!</p>

<h3 id="a005219">what a beautful day for....</h3>

<p>....going out and learning a language.</p>

<p>Today is the <a href="http://www.cilt.org.uk/edl/">European Day of Languages</a>. I wonder if David Blunkett is taking part?</p>

<p>I've been reading a few interesting emails about Blunkett's comments. One linguist thought his comments revealed an assumption that bilingualism was a kind of 'schizophrenia'. Another pointed out that Blunkett was actually arguing for multilingualism, i.e. he thinks parents should add English to their repertoire rather than that kids should drop other languages. I'm sure this could all be used as the basis for a seminar or two.</p>

<h3 id="a005217">fact checking</h3>

<p>Well, I went straight to the source and asked Jim McCloskey, who replied:</p>

<p><q>Billy:</q></p>

<p> <q>Well, I'm partly very chuffed and partly very pissed off that these rumours are around. Jesus Christ, I mean: `fur-lined sheepskin jacket', cheating at Subbuteo, watching `University Challenge'. Not me.</q></p>

<p><q>No, both of these rumours are completely untrue. But I can see what little grain of sand might have provoked each of the pearls to form.</q></p>

<p><q>[1] Feargal Sharkey (lead singer for the Undertones) is my cousin. But the song `My Perfect Cousin' was written by Damian <span class="caps">O'N</span>eill (lead guitar) and Michael Bradley (bass), and it's about Mickey's cousin (not Feargal's or Damian's). I knew this person, and his name really is Kevin, but beyond that I am not willing to go. It's a great song though. I have never owned a fur-lined sheepskin jacket, nor have I ever cheated at Subbuteo.</q></p>

<p><q>[2] No, I was never the drummer for the Hothouse Flowers. But I was the bass player in another Irish band that married traditional music and rock (for want of a better word) music. That band made just one recording, which was re-issued on CD a couple of years ago, and I wrote the sleeve notes for the CD re-issue. That band was important for the evolution of recent Irish music, if I can say this without sounding boastful, not so much because of what we did at the time (which was sort of soppy and amateurish), but because it was the training ground for people who later went on to form the two most important and innovative bands in Irish music of the past 20 years, namely the Bothy Band and Altan. These people are my closest friends. I'm very proud of my (very small) part in what they achieved, and I'm still in close touch with all of them (which mostly these days means going on the piss with them when they come round here to gig, or when I go back home to Ireland).</q></p>

<p><q>Cheers. Thanks for alerting me to this,</q></p>

<p><q>Jim</q></p>

<h2>September 25, 2002</h2>


<h3 id="a005216">Blunkett 'not as wrong as we first thought'?</h3>

<p>Linguists have been discussing David Blunkett's comments about how people should be urged to talk English in their homes. <span class="caps">BAAL </span>(the British Association of Applied Linguists) and the <span class="caps">LAGB </span>(Linguistics Association of Great Britain) are preparing a response to them. But some linguists think what he said might not be so bad after all. Here's the text of what Blunkett said (this is the only reference to language in the whole 20 pages):</p>

<p><q>'I have never said, or implied, that lack of fluency in English was in any way directly responsible for the disturbances in Bradford, Burnley and Oldham in the summer of 2001. However, speaking English enables parents to converse with their children in English, as well as in their historic mother tongue, at home and to participate in wider modern culture. It helps overcome the schizophrenia which bedevils generational relationships. In as many as 30% of Asian British households, according to the recent citizenship survey, English is not spoken at home. But let us be clear that lack of English fluency did not cause the riots.'</q></p>

<p>Some linguists take this as just saying that it could be a problem if parents can't speak a language being used by their kids. On the other hand, others say that it's presupposing English is the main language everywhere in the country. And they raise the question of whether the (local) government in Wales is 'promoting schizophrenia' by promoting use of Welsh as a first language?</p>

<p>Well, I thought I'd pass this on just in case I'm beginning to seem unfairly biased against the lying, deceitful ...</p>

<h3 id="a005215">'dishonest dossier'</h3>

<p> A lot of interesting discussion of yesterday's Iraq debate in the papers today. The most striking piece for me was <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/story.jsp?story=336404">this</a> from Robert Fisk. His main point is that the dossier is full of words like 'if', 'probably' and 'maybe'. If they remain this doubtful then we don't have enough evidence to go to war. If they are not, and therefore Saddam has been managing to carry on building 'weapons of mass destruction', then half a million Iraqi children have been killed for no reason. Here's an extract:</p>

<p><q>Let's go back to 12 May 1996. Madeleine Albright, the US Secretary of State, had told us that sanctions worked and prevented Saddam from rebuilding weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Our Tory government agreed, and Tony Blair faithfully toed the line. But on 12 May, Mrs Albright appeared on <span class="caps">CBS </span>television. Leslie Stahl, the interviewer, asked: 'We have heard that half a million children have died. I mean, that's more than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it?' To the world's astonishment, Mrs Albright replied: 'I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it.'</q></p>

<p><q>Now we know - if Mr Blair is telling us the truth - that the price was not worth it. The price was paid in the lives of hundreds of thousands of children. But it wasn't worth a dime. The Blair 'dossier' tells us that, despite sanctions, Saddam was able to go on building weapons of mass destruction. All that nonsense about dual- use technology, the ban on children's pencils - because lead could have a military use - and our refusal to allow Iraq to import equipment to restore the water-treatment plants that we bombed in the Gulf War, was a sham.</q></p>

<h3 id="a005211">I'm 'that's interesting'</h3>

<p> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/19/technology/circuits/19MESS.htm l?8cir">Here</a> is another interesting article about the effect of those abbreviations inspired by <span class="caps">SMS, </span>the internet etc.</p>

<p><span class="caps">ITIMSVIRAYMD </span>(I think it makes some very interesting reading anyway - you might disagree)</p>

<p>One thing that leapt out at me was when:</p>

<p><q>Montana Hodgen, 16, .. said she was so accustomed to instant- messaging abbreviations that she often read right past them. She proofread a paper last year only to get it returned with the messaging abbreviations circled in red.</q></p>

<p><q>'I was so used to reading what my friends wrote to me on Instant Messenger that I didn't even realize that there was something wrong,' she said. She said her ability to separate formal and informal English declined the more she used instant messages. 'Three years ago, if I had seen that, I would have been `What is that?' '</q></p>

<p>Some good evidence there that the verb <cite>to be</cite> has joined the verb <cite>to go</cite> as an alternative to <cite>say</cite> in reporting speech.</p>

<h3 id="a005210">the singing dancing building society man</h3>

<p>Peter Paphides is on top form in The Guide today (not webbed, as far as I can see) talking about the desire to take the guy from the Halifax ad aside and:</p>

<p><q>...fill him in on the bigger picture that somewhere in Halifax's head office, there's a Mr. Burns character rewinding tapes of that ad and laughing at the willingness with which employees debase themselves for a bit of fame and an end-of-year bonus.</q></p>

<p>As he says, though, it would be a bit like telling a four-year-old that Santa doesn't exist.</p>

<p>There's another interesting article by him about pop music and songwriters <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,794858,00.html">here</a> (<cite> if pop music in the 21st century is carrying on as though the Beatles never happened, there's a good reason for it.

<h3 id="a005207">the last word again</h3>

<p>Well, I guess I'd better stop being a Liberal Democrat and say what I think about this.</p>

<p>First, I don't really give a lot of weight to anyone who goes on about 'breaking the law of the land'. I mean, who hasn't broken the law of the land at some time or other? As I type, Ohna has a photo on her desk which shows her driving our car in a bus lane. She's about 10 yards from the road she's turning left into and her indicator is clearly on, but it's still illegal so she has to hand over 40 quid. And of course we all know that car drivers, motorbikers, cyclists and pedestrians all break the law every day. (I have to say, mind you, that it seems to me like motorcyclists are the most law-abiding of the lot - at least in town). So I think we probably want to separate the question of what the law should be from what our moral attitude is to breaking it.</p>

<p>Second, I don't have that much faith that changing the law or road layouts or traffic signals would have much effect. How often do cars stop between the advanced stop lines for bicycles at traffic lights? How many motorists understand the rules for mini-roundabouts (identical to those for ordinary roundabouts, btw)? How many pedestrians understand that a cycle path is a thing people will probably go cycling on? How many builders with skips/vans/whatever to park could care less? (My favourite cycle path obstacle is the ice cream van which regularly parks on the path in Whittington Park). I don't think cyclists should get too upset about all of this. It's just stuff you need to think about and be aware of and cycle around.</p>

<p>Which leaves the moral question about whether cyclists should break the law or not. My feeling is that nobody should break the law but that if you get upset every time someone does you're heading for dangerously high stress levels.</p>

<p>So what do I do when I meet a red light? Well, usually I stop and wait. I have been known to sneak through when it's really obvious nothing else is moving in the vicinity. And the one place where I think it makes sense is at a busy junction where getting away early means you're out of the way of the motorists before they've got a chance to plough into you.</p>

<p>Anyone want to start on the cycling on the pavement question?</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<h3 id="a005206">Ok, that's it</h3>

<p>(sorry Billy, I couldn't read that last post and not reply - delete away)</p>

<p>"It's the motorists that are the problem."</p>

<p>Ha! until you cyclist types pass a full license and pay road tax you should legally be target practice for the rest of us. It's getting nasty out there as there are, to quote a song lyric, "too many of us". I think now is the time for everyone to get off their fucking high horse and start being a little helpful, courteous and sensible.</p>

<p>In my case, that means: let motorcyclist drive anywhere and park anywhere;-)</p>

<h2>September 19, 2002</h2>


<h3 id="a005205">the last word (here, anyway)</h3>

<p>I'm going to let this correspondent (i.e. <a href="http://www.otherlanguages.org/">Mark</a> have the last word:</p>

<p><q>Isn't it an extraordinary equation? Speeding, lights-jumping motorists kill people. Speeding, lights-jumping cyclists get killed. If the roads were filled with only cyclists, only the very frailest of pedestrians would be killed if hit by a cyclist. If the roads were filled with only motorists, lots lots more people would, and do, get killed.</q></p>

<p><q>How can people ignore this disparity?</q></p>

<p><q>The only reason a rule-breaking cyclist is a problem is that there are motorised road-users around to turn a minor mishap into a lethal disaster. It's the motorists that are the problem.</q></p>

</p>






<h3 id="a005203">the debate goes on</h3>

<p>This discussion is raging on. Cyclists seem pretty evenly divided between those who think it's no biggie to jump a red light (as long as it's carefully done) and those who think it's always wrong, e.g.:</p>

<p><q>Cycling home a few weeks back, waiting at the Duke Street/Oxford Street junction, a gentleman - American, clearly only recently arrived here - came up to me and said: "Back home, all the cyclists jump the lights." I imagine that very shortly afterwards, his naive belief that he arrived in a land of law abiding cyclists was shattered.</q></p>

<p><q>My problem with people jumping lights is twofold - first of all, it creates a bad impression which makes it harder to campaign for cyclists. Secondly, it encourages others to do the same - I now regularly see motorcyclists jump lights, probably as a direct result of cyclists' behaviour.</q></p>

<h2>September 18, 2002</h2>


<h3 id="a005202">a question of intent</h3>

<p>Another cyclist comments:</p>

<p><q>From a legal perspective, the policeman is correct. Intent is a rather important concept in law.</q> </p>

<p><q>By stopping, your friend showed herself to be aware of the light against her. Had she not stopped, she could have pleaded that she had not seen the light. Instead, she made her intent to break the law obvious to the policeman.</q> </p>

<p><q>Providing no one is killed, injured, or placed under stress, the running of a red light (by cars, bicycles, or any other vehicle) is a victimless crime. In fact, society might even gain from the savings in commuting time made by the individuals. Most traffic laws fit this description. However, there is the troubling proviso: no one gets killed etc.</q> </p>

<p><q>Until the highway code is changed to allow cyclists to jump red lights, I'll see them in the same light as the motorists who tear down my residential street at 45mph. After all, they only do it when they think it's safe, and they are saving time.</q> </p>

<h3 id="a005201">give the motorists a chance</h3>

<p>While we're on the subject of red light jumping, a friend of mine (nameless to protect the not innocent) was stopped by police recently for going through a red light on her first day in her new job as a courier. She was given a telling off and, believe it or not, the officer said to her,</p>

<p><q>'and what makes it worse is that you stopped to think about it and have a look to see if anything was coming before you went through'</q></p>

<h3 id="a005200">warning: bored coppers</h3>

<p>Someone (names have been removed to protect the innocent) has been warning cyclists that City of London cops have started giving on the spot fines to cyclists who go through red lights:</p>

<p><q>A colleague told me about it during an after-work drink, and about half an hour later ... on my way home along the deserted City streets I saw a cyclist (in Queen Street) getting his card back from a police motorcyclist. He hopped back on his bike and when he stopped at the next set of lights I asked him about it. 'Done for going through a red light. 30 quid fine.'</q></p>

<p>Another cyclist responded:</p>

<p><q>Ah well, if the streets were deserted it sounds like the traffic cop was just bored. One example doesn't make a trend. And one fine for one violation every x number of years for doing something you do several times a day every day isn't going to stop anybody who does it either.</q></p>

<h3 id="a005195">Stephen King's writing tips</h3>

<p>Scarlett Thomas tore into James N Frey's new writing book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0333907590/">How To Write Damn Good Fiction</a> in Sunday's Independent (not on the web yet, as far as I can see). Not that she needs to, really. I mean, who would dream of buying a book with a title like that?</p>

<p>She obviously doesn't like the idea of 'how to write' books at all, as you can see from the beginning of the review (note the scare quotes):</p>

<p><q>In 'On Writing', the only contemporary writing 'manual' worth reading, Stephen King gives three of the best pieces of advice for people who want to write. He suggests, among many other things, that would-be writers should sit at a humble desk, should avoid TV and should, above everything else, read a lot of books.</q></p>

<p>Stephen King's book is great but it's only partly a writing manual. It's an autobiography focussing on his writing life with a 'toolbox' section with some tips on writing. His tip about the humble desk is one of the best tips in the book. He says you should have a humble desk in the corner of the room to remind you 'that art is a support system for life and not the other way round'.</p>

<p>But my favourite tips were in the toolbox. He begins by saying that what he would really have liked to do would have been just to write a book on grammar but that his editor wouldn't let him. He goes on to show that he does understand grammar (i.e. he doesn't mean that he'd like to go on and on about split infinitives and stuff) by saying that we shouldn't be scared of grammar since we all know it all implicitly. A good grammar course, he says, mainly just tells you what the names are for things you already know about. The two bits of specific linguistic advice he gives are:</p>

<p><q>a) kill all adverbs</q></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><q>b) never use the passive voice</q></p>

<p>You just can't argue with that, can you?</p>

<p> I hate to be negative at a time like this, but I was listening to the memorial service on the radio and the main thing that struck me when listening to the Gettysburg address was the horrible irony that this sentiment was being expressed in a country which had just elected George W Bush (OK, I know they didn't elect him but ykwim).</p>

<h3 id="a005192">watch-and-be-amazed-dog</h3>

<p>A highlight of today was watching <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/lifestyle/watchdog/">Watchdog</a>. Nicky Campbell approached someone who had (allegedly) ripped off 16 of their viewers. Instead of punching the camera and yelling abuse, this guy talked effusively about how hard it was for him. I think he said there would be full employment for everyone if people would just give him a chance.</p>

<p>Anyway, the amazing moment was when he came out clutching a wad and handed over the money that each of the Watchdog viewers said he'd ripped off from them.</p>

<p>What a refreshing change!</p>

<h3 id="a005191">John Pilger on Palestine</h3>

<p> The <cite>Stop The War Coalition</cite> just asked me to publicise this:</p>

<p><q>John Pilger's Palestine film set for late slot by TV company.</q></p>

<p><q>John Pilger's new documentary, "Palestine is still the issue", is due to be broadcast on <span class="caps">ITV </span>on Monday 16th September...but the broadcast time has been moved to 11pm.</q></p>

<p><q>John's film comes at a crucial time and focuses on a central issue in the 'war against terrorism'. It will be a vital educational experience for millions of people in the immediate run-up to the Stop the War Coalition demonstration on 28th September where John is one of the platform speakers.</q></p>

<p><q>Please use your email and website facilities to advertise John's film, including the showing time. John has also said that he is happy for campaigning organisations to use videos of the film for meetings and discussions.</q></p>

<h3 id="a005190">Chomsky on Iraq</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.zmag.org/ZNET.htm"><span class="caps">ZNET</span></a> has just put up part of an interview (full version next month) with Chomsky on Iraq (scroll down a bit on the right-hand column).</p>

<p>I find Chomsky's political views mainly spot on, although I don't think he always communicates them that well. I like <cite>'Bush#1'</cite> as a way of referring to the older Bush, although I don't know whether that's a Chomsky coinage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/permalinker/?pid=6670&amp;blog=donkey">dug</a> has some important thoughts about 9/11 and Iraq. I agree with the general points but I actually agree with <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=2870">Christopher Hitchens</a> on one thing, which is that people have responded much less hysterically than you might have expected, and that this contrasts with the received account of the reaction after Pearl Harbour.</p>

<p>Went to the <a href="http://www.instituteofvisualculture.org">Institute of Visual Culture</a> in Cambridge yesterday to celebrate the opening of their new building in the grounds of the Fitzwilliam Museum, and a new piece by Angela Bulloch. It's a really good piece, about pixels and colour and Zabriskie Point and deja vu and ...., and a great building too (all thanks to Stefan's hard work). The kids put a comment in the book - <cite>'loud but enjoyable'</cite> - and then started cartwheeling on the flat roof of another little building in the grounds. We were wondering if we should be worried but then all the guests applauded them and they were embarrassed enough to get down. </p>

<h3 id="a005186">the third reason</h3>

<p>Apart from being particularly shocked by Blunkett's brazen dishonesty, and impressed by Paul Vallely's comments, I'm interested in this because these utterances are great to use in class. You can use them to talk about how meanings are communicated in general as well as in these weaselly ways, and also to show how you can understand these things using a theoretical approach. I do still get depressed when I see politicians getting away with things like this, even though I've seen it so blooming often.</p>

<h3 id="a005185">a brief history of a fib</h3>

<p>For historians, you can read a report of the <cite>'read my lips'</cite> quote <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/education/story/0,9147,451853,00.html">here</a> What Blunkett said was:</p>

<p><q>'Let me say this very slowly indeed. In fact, if you can, watch my lips - no selection either by examination or interview under a Labour government.'</q></p>

<p>You can read Nick Assinder on what Blunkett said when selection under a Labour government was confirmed <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/675816.stm">here</a>.</p>

<p>The first explanation offered was that he really meant <cite>'no further selection'</cite> but didn't bother to correct the misunderstanding for a few years until the selection policy was confirmed. The second explanation was that it was clearly just a joke. The problem, as Nick Assinder pointed out, was:</p>

<p><q>... few believe that, by quoting US President George Bush's famous words "Read my lips, no new taxes" , Mr Blunkett was actually saying there would be selection under Labour.</q></p>

<p>Went to see the Sleek geeks at the Soho Theatre on Friday evening. Basically, they tell you funny stuff which has a bit of a science connection about it. Highlights included Mike the headless chicken who was one of the highest earning performers in the world for eighteen months in the late 1940s after he had his head chopped off and survived (tragically he died by suffocating on his own bodily fluids in a motel room in Arizona after a gig), and the slide showing us that a collection of stars-to-be millions of light years across the galaxy are giving us all the finger as I type.</p>

<h3 id="a005180">verblessness</h3>

<p>Just read <a href="http://linguistlist.org/issues/13/13-2195.html">a linguist who is dismayed</a> by the lack of accuracy in a discussion of <cite>'sentences without verbs'</cite> on Lehrer News Hour. You can read a transcript of the show <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/media/july-dec01/verb_8-24.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>I dunno, I just think they're people talking about language like what people do. It might have been a good idea to get a linguist on the show, but then they might have scared their viewers off with white coat syndrome.</p>

<p>And even linguists aren't always technically accurate. I tell my students that they'll never read or hear a sentence (since sentences are abstract/mental representations) and then I comment in their margins when they write something that's <cite>'not a sentence'</cite></p>

<h3 id="a005174">urban adventure</h3>

<p> Me, Holly and Ohna just took five kids on a bit of an adventure cycling round Haringey. We left the house at 5pm and got back just after 8 after cycling round the famous (well, famous to us) Parkland Walk, a disused railway line running from Finsbury Park up to Highgate and picking up again at Muswell Hill to go on to Ally Pally. It's a unique bit of countryside in the middle of the city. You get trees and nature and you get kids spraypainting under bridges (legitimately), skateboarding and setting fire to motorbikes (once, Kiloh and I were cycling along innocently when some kids called out to warn us about the burning bike about to explode right next to us).</p>

<p>This trip involved: tree swings, great views, the littler kids yelling abuse at each other while the bigger ones were oceans of calm, traveller kids warning us we were trespassing on their private property (and their grownups making jocular remarks), millions of near things with pedestrians (including guests at an Indian wedding and an angry man on the reservoir) and their pets, many tumbles (some not intentional), nettle stings, cheeky comments from stoop kids in search of a stoop, Aidan (who'd brought his little radio controlled car) bumping into some serious model fans (<cite>'they're using petrol!'</cite>), and chips and fizzy drinks when we got home. They were all exhausted, but not too tired for a couple of hours of tag in the dark after they'd eaten.</p>

<p>Oh, and we even squeezed in some grownup conversation.</p>

<p>I'm tired.</p>

<h3 id="a005165">holiday moments</h3>

<p> Some moments this week:</p>

<p>- family card games going on until way past bedtime. One night, Kiloh ended the game asleep on my leg under the table. Apoa and Kiloh both seem to have inherited Ohna's card sharp gene, btw.</p>

<p>- had my mobile ring on the beach with a message confirming some work. Always wanted to have that happen to me.</p>

<p>- found some interesting data about the English of seven year olds. I was reading Kiloh's copy of <cite>Girl Talk</cite> where a letter from a reader raved about how much she enjoyed it by saying <cite>'Girl Talk is the bomb'</cite></p>

<p>- found a 'snake' in the garden but it turned out to be a slow worm. Yes, it was slow.</p>

<p>- went round the neighbours to say 'can we have our ball back?' Haven't done that for a few decades. I think the last time I did it old mannie Peerie came chasing after us with a stick.</p>

<p>- the downside. Of course, we've had messages and phone calls about various kinds of building works (supposedly) going on at home.</p>

<p>- oh, and we graduated from crazy golf to 'proper putting'. Highlight of this was watching Apoa carefully, and balletically, lining up every shot.</p>

<h3 id="a005163">hols</h3>

<p> I am in Budleigh Salterton, living without broadband, finding out what my pages look like on different systems and browsers, and missing Jonathan's 40th birthday party, where the guests included Jennifer's famous Cullen Skink. B-(</p>

<p>Still, there are compensations, which include: croquet, football, whist, dozing by the riverbank after a wade, and Otter Ale.</p>

<p>It's also the cat's first holiday and we are relieved to find that she enjoys travelling and thinks of her box as a cosy home rather than a prison. Now we'll have to see what she thinks of the local wildlife.</p>

<h3 id="a005160">giving statistics a bad name</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/informer/story/0,1191,779728,00.html"> This</a> has a comment from Xan Brooks who says that:</p>

<p><q>If the figures are to be believed, we are currently luxuriating in middle of the best year for movies since 1971. Cinema attendance in Britain currently stands at its highest level for more than three decades, with some 174m tickets expected to be sold by December 31. All of which is surely cause for celebration. The economy may be slumping, consumer spending wobbling and the house price bubble about to pop, but at least we've all been to see Scooby Doo and Men in Black <span class="caps">II.</span></q></p>

<p><q>The trouble with statistics, of course, is that they only tell half the story</q></p>

<p>I wonder how robust this statistic is? And does this one only tell half of its own story?</p>

<p>ps This sentence is not true</p>

<h3 id="a005152">FOXP2</h3>

<p> The <cite>'language gene'</cite> research is obviously really interesting and exciting but it strikes me that the phrase <cite>'language gene'</cite> causes a bit of a problem, since people discussing it have to spend a lot of time explaining that there isn't really one single gene that gives us language, etc. etc.</p>

<p>The gene we're talking about is called <span class="caps">FOXP2.</span> An error on <span class="caps">FOXP2 </span>causes a disorder which involves severe language problems. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute compared this gene in humans, chimps, gorillas, orang-utans, rhesus macaque monkeys and mice. They found slight changes in the gene which happened over time. So the assumption is that mutations in the human <span class="caps">FOXP2 </span>gene were important in the development of language.</p>

<h3 id="a005147">grown-up movies</h3>

<p>Went to see <cite>Lantana</cite> last night, which was excellent. I can't post links to an official site as all the ones I visited were broken, but here's part of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0259393">a review</a>I found on <a href="http://www.imdb.com">imdb</a>:</p>

<p><q>In Hollywood the man is a limited creature, and this tendency limits the potential for the movies of America. Let us give thanks that producers in other countries may still find funding for movies not crafted shallowly for the American main-stream!</q></p>

<p><q>Lantana is a brilliant movie. Lantana is not a Hollywood movie, nor an American movie.</q></p>

<p>I'd agree. My opinion is that it's a French movie (it's literally Australian, of course). It's got real people with real personalities who reveal themselves through a combination of what they say and what they do. It isn't just reality, though (e.g. we find the main characters linked by amazing coincidences) but the departures from reality are part of the game and so they don't ruin things in a 24 kind of way.</p>

<p>The non-broken bit of the Australian site describes it as a <cite>'mystery for grown-ups'</cite> so I'm wondering whether it works for younger audiences, given part of the interest is about how marriages work (or don't work). I remember how bemused our 19-year-old au pair was by <cite>In The Mood For Love</cite> which Ohna and I had raved about. She reminded me of my bemusement when I was 14 and went to see <cite>Death In Venice</cite> knowing only that it had death in the title and a double A (a now extinct category, for people over 14) certificate (I thought that told me all I needed to know).</p>

<h3 id="a005146">art and literature</h3>

<p>Had a great day out with O yesterday.</p>

<p>They wouldn't let me in to Matisse-Picasso even though I'm a member. Well, not without joining the colossal queue for a ticket. So I bought the catalogue and decided to go to Paris and see it there. What are the odds that I actually do it?</p>

<p>We went to see Ansel Adams and William Egglestone at the Hayward instead. Two great shows and really good computer resources on Ansel Adams.</p>

<p>We followed that up with <cite>Lost in La Mancha</cite>, a tragic disaster and not really the thing for a producer to watch on her day off.</p>

<p>The highlight was that we followed this with a glass of wine and a deep conversation about scriptwriting, partly informed by William Goldman's ideas on <cite>'Hollywood horseshit'</cite> and the difference between Hollywood films and independent films (Hollywood films reassure you, independent films challenge you).</p>

<h3 id="a005142">'don't let them connect you to Germany'</h3>

<p> <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com">dug</a> is still disappointed with 24. I agree with him. I also thought the last episode was ruined by the commentators who led me to expect some amazing revelation/really shocking final episode. I thought it was a fairly predictable ending. And not letting us see at first whether Nina had killed Teri seemed a bit childish to me. The tension it raised for us was at a meta level and mainly about how much cheek we thought the makers would have. (<cite>'There's no way she wouldn't just kill her. If she hasn't killed her, that's a really big cheat...'</cite>) But even tying her up was weird. We'd just seen her charge around killing everyone she met as soon as she saw them, but Teri gets tied up and a bit of a reassuring chat?</p>

<p>I still might want to borrow <a href="http://chris.carline.org/">Chris's</a> dvd box set, though.</p>

<h3 id="a005141">23 of 24</h3>

<p>Watched that 23rd episode again last night. Enjoyed it more the second time around. I think the irritating things don't have as much of a negative effect when you've seen them once. Also, I was surprised that I interpreted the reactions of our little mole differently now that I knew what was about to be revealed at the end of the episode. There's something satisfying about that, like when you solve a puzzle that seemed impossible and then you find the solution was staring you in the face.</p>

<p>Anyway, all the commentators who've seen the 24th episode seem to think it's the best thing since sliced loaf, so looking forward to tonight, and I can't stop speculating about what the big twist at the end will be. Maybe it's all been a dream in the shower...</p>

<p>Kiloh didn't enjoy the Fun Run. She fell and hurt her knee and then finished the race with a stitch. Her friend Martha won the race, though, which was very exciting. If I wasn't still in the stone age (film age?) I'd have posted a photo of her coming home in despair by now.</p>

<p>Anyway, we've just found out that Kiloh came first in the fundraising part of the competition. She's off being photographed by the Hornsey Journal as I type. Not only that, there's a prize.

<h3 id="a005137">Spy Kids 2</h3>

<p>....is good fun.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com">dug</a> has been having a discussion with <a href="http://chris.carline.org/">Chris</a> about <cite>24</cite>. Chris defends <cite>24</cite> as something that knows it's preposterous and <cite>'knows what it is and sticks with it'</cite>. I can't agree. I think it's got some good points, notably that most people find it quite compulsive, but I think it's poorly (and unevenly) written and directed, and that it 'cheats' in that it wants to be taken as having something to say about the real world (e.g. with the Clinton-Monica-alike subplot) but lets itself down with the preposterousness. I also find that my attention flags after about 20 minutes so that I often miss the sledgehammer-cracking-a-nut that is the hook at the end.</p>

<p>The latest shocking twist reminded me of the scene that, I thought, ruined <cite>Gosford Park</cite> (can't believe that screenplay won an oscar) when Emily Watson's character gives the audience a jaws-hit- the-floor shock by doing something that character would absolutely never do. I think writers should try to amaze their audiences but if you have to resort to out-of-character behaviour or suchlike implausibilities, then you've bought the amazement at the expense of the movie. The shock at the end of the 23rd 'hour' was a double failure in that it was something that could not be the case given the rules of the show, and it was something a lot of members of the audience kind of expected, given that they knew this is a programme that cheats.</p>

<p>Anyway, returning to my point, if you want to see something that's knowingly preposterous and <cite>'knows what it is and sticks with it'</cite>, go and see <cite>Spy Kids 2</cite></p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p>ps. Sorry, of course I can believe that screenplay won, but the main thing that struck me about it was that it had some serious flaws. I'll be surprised if it ends up alongside 'Chinatown', 'Witness' and all in the 'how to write a screenplay' books.</p>

<h3 id="a005136">Mind The Gaffe</h3>

<p>Larry Trask is a top linguist and a great communicator, in books and in person. His book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/041520089X/">Language: The Basics</a> has a really good section on prescriptivism.</p>

<p>Well, now he's followed his (Penguin) Guide To <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140513663/">Punctuation</a> with a book that gives some prescriptions and proscriptions about grammar: <a href=" http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140514767/">Mind The Gaffe</a>. There's a review <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/referenceandlanguages/0,6121,772010,00.html">here</a></p>

<h3 id="a005129">the fool</h3>

<p> More from <a href="http://www.thefridaything.co.uk">The Friday Thing</a>:</p>

<p><q>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, priest and theologian (perhaps the most important theologian of the last century), was hanged by the SS in April of 1945. His last writings are collected in the extraordinary book 'Letters And Papers From Prison' - which is often to be found knocking around in secondhand bookshops, and is certainly worth the 75 pence. There is a section of the book, near the beginning, entitled 'Of Folly', and in it Pastor Bonhoeffer sheds some much needed light on the war with Iraq, and the character of a certain President Bush.</q></p>

<p><q>'There is no defence against folly. Neither protests nor force are of any avail against it, and it is never amenable to reason. If facts contradict personal prejudices, there is no need to believe them, and if they are undeniable, they can simply be pushed aside as exceptions. Thus the fool, as compared with the scoundrel, is invariably self-complacent. And he can easily become dangerous...'</q></p>

<p><q>'The fool can often be stubborn, but this must not mislead us into thinking that he is independent. One feels somehow, especially in conversation with him, that it is impossible to talk to the man himself, to talk to him personally. Instead, one is confronted with a series of slogans, watchwords, and the like, which have acquired power over him. He is under a curse, he is blinded, his very humanity is being prostituted and exploited. Once he has surrendered his will and become a mere tool, there are no lengths of evil to which the fool will not go, yet all the time he is unable to see that it is evil.'</q></p>

<h3 id="a005128">the main thing about war</h3>

<p>From <a href="http://www.thefridaything.co.uk">The Friday Thing</a> today:</p>

<p><q>Not a million miles away is a war. An enormous, stinking, heads-blown-off, children with no legs, anthrax in your cornflakes, shitty mess of a war.

<h3 id="a005126">a new new kind of review</h3>

<p> <a href="http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/13/13-2043.html#1">this one</a> is very short. It's a review of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/019511874X/">this book</a>, which Amazon describes like this:</p>

<p><q>How can an infinite number of sentences be generated from one human mind? How did language evolve in apes? In this book Donald Loritz addresses these and other fundamental and vexing questions about language, cognition, and the human brain. He starts by tracing how evolution and natural adaptation selected certain features of the brain to perform communication functions, then shows how those features developed into designs for human language. The result -- what Loritz calls an adaptive grammar -- gives a unified explanation of language in the brain and contradicts directly (and controversially) the theory of innateness proposed by, among others, Chomsky and Pinker.</q></p>

<p>The reviewer is Katharine Beals who says <cite>maybe Loritz is on to something</cite> and then says <cite>but, for the most part, it's awfully hard to tell</cite></p>

<p>It seems Loritz is going against the idea of linguistic modularity and arguing that language is learned by brain cells. The thing is, the modularity folk also think it's learned by brain cells. The question is whether, at the level of the mind, you need to postulate something language-specific. Looks like I'm going to have to read the book (although this review suggests that won't make it clear to me anyway). Still, these arguments sound like a must-hear to me:</p>

<p><q>Finally, he questions two key claims of generative grammarians: that children learn language effortlessly, and that parents don't teach it to them. In particular, he argues, when a child refers to a cow as a 'koo', the typical parental response-e.g. 'That's right! It's a cow'- is an expansion or recasting that yields implicit negative evidence of the sort that generative grammarians assume is completely absent, but which in fact, through the principles of Adaptive Resonance, causes automatic, subconscious corrections.</q></p>

<p>(I'll ignore the fact that where I grew up, the typical parental- response would have been 'that's right - it's a koo')</p>

<h3 id="a005108">Odeon III: it will not go away</h3>

<p> I know, I know. Nobody's forcing me to go there. The thing that keeps bringing me back is the location. If you want to get to the cinema quickly with kids, it tends to be the simplest option around here.</p>

<p><cite>Men In Black II</cite> was quite satisfying. Particularly enjoyed the Ed Wood-like opening, and I always find Danny Elfman's music does the job quite well.</p>

<p>I had trouble hearing what the actors were saying. Not sure if it was the mix or if I'm just getting old. Felt a bit like watching a movie in French without subtitles. Luckily, the details of the plot were not that vital.</p>

<p>But, of course, tragically, I was in an Odeon. At least this time the film was in focus and the sound was good (not for the adverts, though - if I'd paid to put my groovy Oakenfold-soundtracked ad on there, I'd want my money back).</p>

<p>This was the Muswell Hill Odeon, which could so easily be turned into a magnificent cinema. The place used to be stacked with old projectors. They've gone now, so if you're in the main screen there's only an upstairs and you can look down at the pitiful sight of the empty ground floor below. Because of this, the front rows (where we usually sit) are now the expensive seats. So 100 people sat dotted around the back of the cinema while the 'sofa seats' at the front sat empty. There are three cheap seats mingling on the edges of the sofas, so Apoa, Kiloh and I sat separately waving at each other. From where I was sitting, the bottom right of the screen had a 4-inch thick rail across it. It all felt very post-world war, evoking the great British spirit of 'mustn't grumble', and reminded me of one of my great cinema moments: getting up the day after the hurricane to walk past trees sitting on cars etc. to the Notting Hill Coronet. In those days it was London's coldest cinema (you had to remember to bring your coat) and the last cinema to allow smoking. We sat shivering watching <cite>Hope and Glory</cite> with reminiscing <span class="caps">OAP</span>s making up the rest of the audience. I'm sure John Boorman would have approved.</p>

<h3 id="a005100">Apoa's latest joke</h3>

<p>I hesitate to report this, but here goes.</p>

<p>Partly inspired by my desktop calendar of New Yorker cartoons (thanks Jim and Elsie), Apoa (9 years old) told me today about this joke she's just made up:</p>

<p>A woman has cancer and she's going to die. The doctor tells her husband. And he replies, <cite>Oh, don't worry. I've got her insured.</cite></p>

<p>She's grasped quite a few features of the genre, but I think she needs to do a bit more work on that fine line between comedy and tragedy.</p>

<h3 id="a005099">pet theory (nothing to do with cats)</h3>

<p>(Inspired by discussion of syllables at <a href="http://www.notsosoft.com/blog">Meg's blog</a>):</p>

<p>imho, linguistic variation is one area where those blooming rampant globalisation processes just aren't as rampant as we tend to think.</q></p>

<p>Why not? Because humans are complicated mechanisms and their face-to-face interactions carry more weight for them than things like what comes out of the box in the corner.</p>

<p>And here's the pet theory: the stuff from the box only matters to us if we think it matters to the people we meet face to face.</p>

<h3 id="a005089">scapecats</h3>

<p> Article about the investigation into the decline of sparrows and starlings in today's <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk">Independent</a>.</p>

<p>It's an interesting report, and another good topic for teaching about research projects. I wonder, though, about the journalistic decisions which put a headline <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/story.jsp?story=320360">here</a> (front page of print version) saying that <cite>Scientists blame cats for decline of sparrows</cite> while the headline <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/story.jsp?story=320324">here</a> (on page 13 of the print version) says that <cite>Cats, cars, and cleaner streets lead to the fall of a once-common bird</cite>.</p>

<p>It seems that we're still not sure but think it could be a combination of factors, including cats.</p>

<p>Great photo of a sparrow with the inside story, btw.</p>

<h3 id="a005088">Language of the Third Reich</h3>

<p> <a href="http://www.linguistlist.org"><span class="caps">LINGUIST</span></a> just told me about this book. Anyone heard of it?</p>

<p><q><span class="caps">THE LANGUAGE</span> OF <span class="caps">THE THIRD REICH</span></q> <q><span class="caps">LTI</span>: Lingua Tertii Imperii</q></p>

<p><q>Victor Klemperer</q></p>

<p><q> Under the Third Reich, the official language of Nazism came to be used as a political tool. The existing social culture was manipulated and subverted as the German people had their ethical values and their thoughts about politics, history and daily life recast in a new language. This notebook, translated by Martin Brady and originally called <span class="caps">LTI </span>(Lingua Tertii Imperii) - the abbreviation itself a parody of Nazified language - was written out of Klemperer's conviction that the language of the Third Reich helped to create its culture. As Klemperer writes: 'it isn't only Nazi actions that have to vanish, but also the Nazi cast of mind, the typical Nazi way of thinking, and its breeding ground: the language of Nazism.'This brilliant, entertaining, profound and ultimately saddening and horrifying book, is one of the great Twentieth-Century studies of language and of its engagement with history.</q></p>

<p>No review yet or anything, but <a href="http://www.nme.com/news/102497.htm">here</a> is a brief mention of the jubilee celebration from the <a href="http://www.nme.com">nme</a> (you know, that thing the Sex Pistols used to use?).</p>

<p>It seems John attacked the Queen among others, which cheers me up. I was getting a bit worried by his <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2010060.stm">'not an anti-royalist'</a> line recently (especially when comparing it with his 'not a fascist just because I'm an anti-royalist' bit in <a href="http://www.annoying.com/nightmares/gnp/gnp-library/00/04/0002.html">No Irish No Blacks No Dogs</a>).</p>

<p>It seems he also said <cite>I'm sorry for nothing to no-one, ever</cite>. I totally agree with that. But I'm a bit unsure about the double negative. I grew up with negative concord, i.e. for us <cite>I never did nothing</cite> meant the same as <cite>I did nothing</cite>. But for those prescriptivists and others who ain't not got it, am I right in thinking that the two negatives here don't make a positive because of the kinds of negatives they are?</p>

<p>Intuitions fail me.</p>

<h3 id="a005078">Safire annoys Pat</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/28/magazine/28ONLANGUAGE.html">William Safire</a> has just been picked on by <a href="http://www.fieldmethods.net/blog/">a blog with a name that keeps changing</a>. Not too harshly, though. The comment is <cite> William Safire, you annoy me</cite>.</p>

<p>I thought the funniest bit was when Safire, who has been telling us what he thinks (about language, mainly) in the <span class="caps">NYT </span>for about a million years says that he doesn't want to set up a blog himself because <cite>'I don't want anyone to know what I think'</cite></p>

<p>Hard to know what to say to that, isn't it?</p>

<h3 id="a005077">they slapped our face but we're still happy</h3>

<p>Message at the front of the latest <a href="http://www.thefridaything.co.uk">Friday Thing</a>:</p>

<p><q>Hurrah! The Friday Thing is one year old this week. And what a year it's been. We've weathered the media downturn, survived <span class="caps">T.T.E.O.</span> September 11th, slapped our readers in the face by switching to paid subs only and yet have still managed to remain the <span class="caps">UK'</span>s most successful paid-for current affairs email magazine.</q></p>

<p>Why have they done so well? My theories:</p>

<p>- not charging too much</p>

<p>- giving enough in return to justify payment</p>

<p>- simplicity</p>

<p>- a kind of independence</p>

<p>The independence idea might need a bit of explaining. What I have in mind is that you won't be happy with everything you read, but you know that the contributions are 'honest' and not accompanied by too much of an agenda slapping you in the face (one slap is enough, I reckon)</p>

<p>Kiloh used to be a chocaholic. Then she found out about the negative connotations of the <cite>-holic</cite> bit, so now she's a chocophile.</p>

<p>Breakfast yesterday started with a nutella-covered pancake with sausage and fried egg. By the end she'd invented the chocolate-coated sausage, and yes, even fried egg with chocolate topping. Her next plan is to substitute chocolate for corn as the staple diet for hens.</p>

<h2>July 26, 2002</h2>


<h3 id="a005072">reading and phonics</h3>

<p>Two languagey stories in today's Independent, both useable for teaching, I think.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/story.jsp?story=318457">This</a> is about research which claims to show that the numbers of parents reading to kids has more than doubled in the past two years and that now 90% of parents regularly make time to read to their kids. It doesn't say whether that's 90% of parents in England, in the world, in the <span class="caps">UK, </span>or in Hampstead, but I must admit that I find that figure hard to believe, so I'm going to try to find out more details about the research.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/story.jsp?story=318456">This one</a> baffles (now there's a word) me a bit. It starts by saying that a return to traditional methods of teaching reading has reversed the trend for girls to do better than boys at school. Then it says the method returned to is <cite>phonics</cite>, which my kids have been exposed to for the past 5 years. Then it says it's in Scotland and started 5 years ago. Then it says that we've been doing phonics in England since 1998 (i.e. 4 years ago) but it's more gradual down here. I think that what's being reported is a comparison between Scottish kids before and after phonics (not clear which ones were measured how as the 'before' group). But I'd like to know about English kids and what their gradual phonics is doing to them.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, just watched an episode of <a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.co.uk/microsites/cramptwins/">The Cramp Twins</a> where a researcher decides to do some tests showing that Wayne and Lucien are completely alike, uses unusual methods to try to make sure the results come out <span class="caps">OK, </span>and ends up making them swap personality types.</p>

<h3 id="a005060">stop press: hitler NOT a vegetarian</h3>

<p>Jonathan says:</p>

<p><q>contrary to reports from almost every pub in the country, and track 2 of The Residents' Third Reich'n'Roll, I am reliably informed by a letter in the Sunday Herald (<a href="http://www.sundayherald.com/news">http://www.sundayherald.com/news</a> except they don't put letters up on the site) that Hitler was <span class="caps">NOT </span>a vegetarian</p>

<p>another blow for truth </q></p>

<p>And here's the letter:</p>

<p><q></p>

<p>. . . . . . . . . </p>

<p>Aaron Hicklin states in his column that Hitler may have been a vegetarian (Magazine, July 14). This myth about Hitler's supposed vegetarian diet needs to be quashed once and for all. Far from being a vegetarian, Hitler ate vast quantities of animal flesh, so much so that he suffered serious health problems. His periodic abstinence from meat was, indeed, done so as to get him on the road to better health again which, once achieved, would see him return to his heavy meat diet. One food author, Rynn Berry, was so fed up at hearing the Hitler-veggie myth that he wrote a booklet about it and also included a short chapter about why Hitler was not a vegetarian in his book, Famous Vegetarians and Their Favorite Recipies.</p>

<p>What a pity that not just Aaron Hicklin, but all newspaper editors and food writers didn't attend the World Vegetarian Congress held recently in Edinburgh. The horrific clips of how animals are treated - or rather mistreated - in order that we supposedly civilised humans can eat them would have hopefully been enough to put them off consuming meat and animal-related products for life.</p>

<p>Sandra Busell</p>

<p>Edinburgh</p>

<p>. . . . . . . . . </q></p>

<p>It strikes me, though, that if you are fed up with the Hitler-veggie myth, maybe there are better ways of attacking it than talking about Hitler in a book called <cite> Famous Vegetarians and their Favourite Recipes</cite></p>

<h3 id="a005059">Hitler was a vegetarian</h3>

<p>Thanks to Jonathan, I've been enjoying <cite>Hitler was a vegetarian</cite> from <cite>Third Reich 'N' Roll</cite> by The Residents, which rates <cite>nine big happy guys</cite> <a href="http://www.crackerbox.net/audio/review/resthird.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>It's great to cook to, and the perfect backdrop to semicommunication with Aki, our Japanese lodger. We particularly enjoyed it when they 'did' the Beatles Band.</p>

<h3 id="a005053">pseudo-gapping asymmetry and other mouthfuls</h3>

<p> Academics were pretty quick in getting email, access to the web, etc. but they've been pretty slow in using the web fully to help them with their quest to further human knowledge and all.</p>

<p>But things are improving. Just got a message from <a href="http://www.linguistlist.org/"><span class="caps">LINGUIST</span></a> telling me about the latest issue of <a href="http://www.ledonline.it/snippets/">Snippets</a>, an online journal publishing squibs on syntax and semantics in pdf format.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.glotinternational.com/">glot</a> are the pioneers of this in the linguistics world, and they're now pioneering the concept of charging us money for the journal too. To get it you have to subscribe to Linguistlist Plus which costs 35 squids/50 US dollars. I can see the logic in terms of what you get for your money, but I also don't think it's the way to go.</p>

<p>At the same time, it seems you can just click through and get all the articles even if you haven't paid. (Nobody tell them - remember what happened with the emergency staircase at Covent Garden tube station)</p>

<p>But it also means they're more visible when they get here B-)</p>

<p>Anyway, Mark said:</p>

<p><q> So, Clark, why DO some people get the surname treatment? I once saw a poster for a film with Belushi... but of course, Belushi is dead, it was only James Belushi. My reaction was that it was wrong... in the circumstances, disrespectful... I don't often feel a strong reaction to film posters! I wonder if it was a deliberate ploy to get a reaction and hence draw attention to the film? </q></p>

<p>My opinions are:</p>

<p>First, let's only ever call people by their 'first' names from now on and forgot all those honorifics like <cite>Mr</cite>. And to hell with <a href="http://www.spinnwebe.com/tpa/">those pesky apostrophes</a> while we're at it. And what's with all this <cite>Mrs./Ms/Miss</cite> stuff? I love the German solution where they just decreed that all women are <cite>frau</cite> from now on.</p>

<p>Second, it's all got to do with old-fashioned conventions. As the feedback man said, if David Beckham was <cite>'the accused'</cite> in a courtroom (which could never ever happen, of course, etc.) he'd be <cite>Mr. Beckham</cite> for a while and then he'd be just <cite>David Beckham</cite> again once he'd been acquitted (which is of course what would definitely happen if there ever was such a travesty of justice etc. etc.)</p>

<p>Third, isn't it funny how American academics are less formal than other English speakers in lots of ways but lots more formal in others, e.g. using surnames to address their mates when presenting academic papers?</p>

<h3 id="a005050">the ageing process</h3>

<p>Mark just reminded me of the days when <a href="http://www.rocklist.net/festive50.htm">John Peel's Festive 50</a> was blooming important. It still makes me happy to look at a chart that includes 'Sheela-na-gig', 'The Classical', 'Debaser', ... et setter-ah, et-setter-ah....

<p> <a href="http://punkprincess.com/blog/">The punk princess</a> is also one of many reporting the death of Alan Lomax.</p>

<p>I'd never visited <a href="http://www.alan-lomax.com/">his website</a> until now. It's great.

<h3 id="a005046">artificial intonation</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/feedback.shtml">Feedback on Radio 4</a> is always a good source for linguistic data. Last week, someone pointed out interesting variations in usage of titles by sports commentators. Sometimes they say <cite>Mr.</cite> so-and-so and sometimes they just use a bare surname. There was an explanation for all of the differences except one. No-one could explain why most football managers just get a surname, e.g. Kevin Keegan is usually referred to as <cite>Keegan</cite>, while that guy who manages England now is referred to as <cite>Mr. Eriksson</cite>.</p>

<p>My own theory is that he's an alien with powers. Only some kind of Jedi-mind-trick thing could explain how he turned the whole of England temporarily sane during the last world cup.</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/rams/feedback.ram"> this week</a> there's a bit about how some presenters keep going artificially up at the end of every sentence they utter while others go artifically down.</p>

<h3 id="a005045">Just A Little Boy</h3>

<p>Last night I was driving home with a bunch of 7-9 year old girls. I could go on about all the entertainment they supplied. But instead of telling you about Apoa's definition of a condom as <cite>'something a man puts on his willy so that the woman doesn't get sick'</cite> or their blase attitude to the holy grail - <cite>'why's that hard to get hold of? we've got it on video at home'</cite>, I'll just tell you about their new lyrics for <cite>Just A Little Girl</cite>. The original goes:</p>

<blockquote><p><cite> I'm just a little girl you see</p></blockquote>

<p>But there's a hell of a lot more to me</p>

<p>Don't ever underestimate what I can do</p>

<p>Don't ever tell me how I'm meant to be </cite> </p>

<p>Their new version is:</p>

<blockquote><p><cite> He's just a little boy you see</p></blockquote>

<p>He doesn't sit down when he goes for a wee</p>

<p>But never understimate what he can do</p>

<p>He will sit down for a poo </cite> </p>

<h3 id="a005042">budgies singin mingin</h3>

<p> Well, they used the word <cite>mingin</cite> in one of their songs, so that was something.</p>

<p>The show is still a bit embryonic but it's definitely got potential. The venue was the Muswell Hill Village Club, a beautiful arched wooden ceiling above a room the size of your average knocked-through living room. Around 20 of us surrounding the 'stage' (i.e. the floor), watching the boy/budgies hatch and sing their lives for 45 minutes. Essentially, it's a story of angst and loneliness redeemed through non-homosexual love (key song "We're Not Gay"). They're expanding it now, which I think it needs, as it's mainly a bunch of connected songs and could do with a bit more texture, iykwim. I think I interpreted correctly that a key character difference between the boys was that one was a Bob Dylan fan and the other a Morrissette (n.b. that means a Morrissey fan, not the unironic one).</p>

<p>It reminded me of a rather strange moment when I was talking to a potential au pair and she asked me, <cite>Do you like crazy shows?</cite>. Maybe this is what she had in mind.</p>

<p>Talking of crazy shows, tonight it's Green Day at Wembley, where I'm co-chaperone to half a dozen 14 year old boys. Anybody want to swap?</p>

<h3 id="a005040">mingin</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/">plasticbag</a> comments on the word <cite>ming</cite> which has been being used more frequently lately, in the media and elsewhere. I always thought of it as a Scottish word, and I'm pretty sure it was born in Scotland, but it's getting more common in English English.</p>

<p>I wonder if we can get English people to adopt other phrases. Our nickname for Meryl Streep used to be Meryl Gypit Neep. The <cite>Gy</cite> bite rhymes with the <cite>rhy</cite> of <cite>rhymes</cite> (which is pronounced differently by Scottish and English speakers, of course). Eventually, we had a bit of rhyming slang where referring to someone as a <cite>Meryl</cite> meant they were a gypit neep. I don't think this one was picked up on in the story about <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,706929,00.html">Scottish Rhyming Slang</a> from a while ago. I wonder if it'll get dictionaried one day?</p>

<p>Looks like The Coral's publicity and output are stepping up a gear. New single out tomorrow, cover of <span class="caps">NME </span>next week, live 15-minute set on Radio 1's Evening Session next Monday (22nd), album out 29th July (with reviews in this month's Q and Mojo).</p>

<p>The single is 'Goodbye', which was sadly one of the weaker numbers when I saw them last week. But I guess it was also the most catchy, standard pop tune-like number.</p>

<p>But the interesting thing for me is that the video claims to have a 'Wicker Man' aspect to it. Tried to watch it on <a href="http://www.thecoral.co.uk">their website</a> but the link seems to be broken.</p>

<h3 id="a005030">the lavender of the subjunctive</h3>

<p>A <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4459711,00.html ">review</a> of the <a href="http://uk.cambridge.org/linguistics/cgel/">Cambridge Grammar of the English Language</a>, exploring once again <a href="http://www.xrefer.com/entry/441730">descriptive and prescriptive approaches to language</a>.</p>

<p>There was a time when these were seen as completely incompatible. They're referred to as <cite>'polar values'</cite> <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/68/45/4745.html">here</a>, which I'm not sure I understand. But there's been more and more work which takes both approaches seriously. When I started linguistics, linguists tended to sneer at all prescriptive attitudes. But nowadays, people are more careful only to say that prescribing is not something linguists should do when they're 'at work'.</p>

<p>In the old days, a typical argument would use an analogy with physics. Physicists try to work out what the world is like, they don't say what it should be like. And linguists should just describe what people say and understand rather than saying what they should do. But a linguist on his day off is now allowed to despise misplaced apostrophes and stuff, just like a physicist is allowed to hope an apple will fall off a tree.</p>

<h3 id="a005028">cat boundaries</h3>

<p> Finally bought a super hi-tech cat flap, complete with unique magnetic collar thingie so that only Jaz can come and go, and that bully of an ex-mum next door can't come in and terrorise her (Blossom's behaviour reminds me of the Sour Grapes on the Banana Splits show).</p>

<p>Anyway, after destroying my back door and fitting it upside down anyway, I got some help from Mark, the builder-in-residence next door. We rebuilt the door and got it all sorted in the panel next to the door ('where it should have been all along, lad').</p>

<p>Now the cat doesn't want to go through it. I think she has a bit of a liminality fetish.</p>

<h3 id="a005026">Bessie and Ted</h3>

<p>Surreal start to the day.</p>

<p>For ages, I've been being urged (most recently by Sue, who's especially keen) to write the story of my family, in particular of my mum Bessie. Part of this story is about Bessie's two marriages to Ted. She first married him during the war when she was 19. Following a pregnancy by someone else, they divorced and had no contact for 56 years, when they got back in touch and got married again.</p>

<p>Well, I got up this morning and, while wandering around the kitchen and trying to get the cat out from under my feet, I switched on the radio and heard a familiar voice on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hometruths/">Home Truths</a>. There was my mum having a chat with John Peel. You can hear it <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hometruths/hometruths.ram">here</a>, (it starts 7 minutes and 18 seconds in)</p>

<p>B~}</p>

<h3 id="a005025">more on linguists and boycotts</h3>

<p><a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,9830,754567, 00.html">Here</a> is another article about the linguists at <span class="caps">UMIST </span>and the academic boycott of Israel. This is a complicated question, I think, and I'm saving the emails I'm receiving about it. Maybe I'll post them or links to them soon.</p>

<p>btw, in the spirit of <a href="http://www.knucklerap.com">knucklerap</a> (well, more like praise for not needing a knuckle rap), can I say how nice it is to see the past tense of the verb <cite>lead</cite> spelt properly in the headline of this article? I think this is a case where the mis-spelling is getting so common that it might soon become the standard (in the same way as <cite>whacky</cite> and <cite>whacko</cite> seem to have replaced <cite>wacky</cite> and <cite>wacko</cite>)</p>

<p>While looking for Lips, I did find <a href="http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/music/interviews/story.jsp?st ory=312009">this article</a> about <a href="http://www.the-vines.net/">The Vines</a>, who are the latest band with a big buzz about them.</p>

<p>The album is good in a Stooges (lyric for '1969': 'it's 1969 in my head') meets Nirvana meets slightly-boring-anthemic-kind-of-Travis-melodies-that-every-indie-band-who-claims-to-hate-Travis-seems-to-play-these-days kind of way.</p>

<p>The main reason I like them is that Craig Nicholls, the lead singer, performs some songs in a barking mad manner which involves pulling expressions just like Kiloh's when she impersonates her grandma (Bessie) sleeping in the car.</p>

<p>One linguist responding to the earlier message about boycotts said:</p>

<blockquote><p>What I find ironic is that this is happening in linguistics departments. We do all this research on prototypes, stereotypes, discourse communities and so on, then we get sacked because someone who has half-absorbed Aristotelean categorisation confuses essential and accidental attributes. </p></blockquote>

<h3 id="a005017">Linguists against boycotts</h3>

<p> Just received this via a mailing list for Cognitive Linguists (I've deleted the names of the linguists who made the statement, just to save space):</p>

<blockquote><p>The statement below deals with an issue that is of importance to all linguists. Please respond as you feel is appropriate. Thanks.</p></blockquote>

<p> Academic Boycotts in Linguistics</p>

<p> Several months ago a number of European academics initiated a campaign to boycott cooperation with Israeli universities and other research institutions as an expression of oppostion to Israel's military response to the Palestinian intafada. A counter-boycott protest soon followed, and the controversy over this issue has become intense. Until recently we would not have considered writing to the Linguist List on this matter, as it was a general problem of the relation between politics and academic life. However, it has now become a matter which concerns linguists directly. Several weeks ago Dr. Mona Baker, Director of the Centre for Translation and Intercultural Studies at the University of Manchester Institute for Science and Technology (UMIST) dismissed two Israeli scholars from the editorial boards of translation journals which she edits. She removed Professor Gideon Toury of the Dept. of General and Comparative Literature at Tel Aviv University from the board of Translator: Studies in Intercultural Communication, and Dr. Miriam Shlesinger of the Unit of Translation and Interpreting Studies at Bar-Ilan Universtiy from the board of Translation Studies Abstracts. Her stated reason for doing this is that she thought that it was an appropriate way of implementing the boycott.</p>

<p> In our view, academic boycotts in general and Dr. Baker's mode of observing this one in particular are entirely unacceptable for at least two obvious reasons. First, they are directed at scientific researchers who have no direct connection to government policy. These actions target people without reference to their views or actions, but solely on the basis of the fact that they live and work in a particular country whose government the supporters of the boycott object to. In this respect academic boycotts are no less racist than the exclusionary policies that they purport to oppose. It is interesting to note in the present instance that Dr. Shlesinger is a past chair of the Israeli branch of Amnesty International and a long time critic of Israel's policies in the occupied territories. Second, this boycott is acutely discriminatory in that it focuses exculsively on Israel, and takes no account of the severe human rights abuses and brutal military interventions committed by other countries, often on a larger scale. So, for example, no academic boycott has, to the best of our knowledge, been applied to Russia in response to its war in Chechnya, to Serbia when Milosevic pursued his campaign througout the former Yugoslavia, or to China in reaction to its long standing occupation of Tibet and its problematic human rights record at home. Most tellingly, we do not recall anyone seriously attempting to launch a boycott of American academic institutions despite the many controversial military adventures that the United States has engaged in over the past several decades. It is difficult to avoid the suspicion that the current group of boycott enthusiasts would be less than anxious to give up lucrative sabbaticals and research opportunities at American institutions.</p>

<p> Most of us strongly oppose Israel's continued occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem. However, we do not regard an academic boycott of Israeli universities or researchers as an acceptable means for expressing one's objections to the policies and actions of the Israeli government. We agree with Noam Chomsky's view that one does not boycott people or their cultural institutions as an expression of political protest, particularly when the actions of other governments, often one's own, are no less worthy of opposition. We call on our colleagues to oppose this and all other academic boycotts. We urge them not to engage in discriminatory behaviour of this kind.</p>

<h3 id="a005014">I use the NME</h3>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.nme.com/news/102301.htm">this research report</a>, 75% of Oasis fans thought Finsbury Park was better than Knebworth.</p>

<p>Think I'll get the students to investigate the research methodology employed here. Putting aside questions about how exciting this research finding is, could it be, for example, that you don't get the most calm, rational assessment from fans who are pissed out of their faces on the way out of the gig? (Judging by the state of some of them, I'm surprised they managed to get them to emit sounds interpretable as words).</p>

<h3 id="a005006">In or Out?</h3>

<p>If you want a sensible debate about the euro, <a href="http://www.fabian-society.org.uk/">the Fabian Society</a> have produced a publication which presents two sides of the argument (both from a left of centre perspective, of course). Here's the blurb from it:</p>

<blockquote><p>The euro has been the subject of fierce debate for years. Yet how many Britons can honestly say they understand the issues or have formed a considered view? Now, with the introduction of notes and coins, the euro debate has changed markedly. It is no longer theoretical; soon millions of British citizens will have felt the currency in their hands; thousands of companies will daily be dealing in euros. </p></blockquote>

<p>The debate about British entry should not wait until a referendum has been called, but should start now. This should not be a private argument about tactics and timing, or even solely about the relative economic advantages; it is a question of fundamental principle and of politics, especially for those on the left of centre. There are real choices to be made by social democrats about the future direction of progressive politics in Europe and the <span class="caps">UK.</span> The two essays in <cite>In or Out? Labour and the euro</cite>, the first by Andrew Gamble, the second by Janet Bush &amp; Larry Elliott, set out in a clear and accessible manner the left of centre case for and against UK membership, making a valuable contribution to one of the most important debates of the present political era. </p>

<p>It makes me wonder why so many members of the main pro and anti euro camps have avoided, or tried to postpone, a sensible discussion.</p>

<p> And here's Jennifer's Cullen Skink recipe:</p>

<blockquote><p><cite> Now, cullen skink I am an expert at (you have to left dislocate whenever you talk about it ) and soooo easy.</p></blockquote>

<p>so...bile tatties and an onion in water and salt until the tatties are semi soft. then drain and add about two pints of full fat coronary milk, a blob of butter and two/three pieces of smoked haddock (preferably on the bone - finnan haddie - but unless you're in Cairnbulg or Buckie, this is kind of hard). Cook very slowly for about twenty mins/half an hour - <span class="caps">DINNA LIT</span> IT <span class="caps">BILE, FITEVER</span> YE <span class="caps">DEE</span>!! Add s&amp;p to taste. Eat with oatcakes (nane o' yer Duchy shite) while singing fishing songs in an Isla St Clair type manner (did you know she was really plain old Sinclair?) </p>

<p>there are variations on this including adding some carnation milk (my mam) or using horror of horrors margarine. but I like it this way.</cite> </p>

<h3 id="a005002">where's adolf?</h3>

<p>Another of our barbie guests at the weekend produced <a href="http://www.no-euro.co.uk/mediacentre/film/smallfilm.mpg">the no euro video</a> It became clear right away that this was a delicate subject for her, so there was a bit of a <cite>'don't mention the euro'</cite> vibe around the garden.</p>

<p>Since then, though, I've been involved in a few serious discussions of the pros and cons, sparked by small talk about the film, so maybe its had a positive impact in the end (even if its immediate effect has been exactly the opposite of what its makers had hoped for).</p>

<p>They've finally put up a low (=as low as you can go) resolution version on <a href="http://www.no-euro.com/">their website</a>. I don't know whether it's a downloading problem, but the <cite>ein volk, ein reich, ein euro</cite> bit doesn't appear when I run it, although I do catch a glimpse of Rik Mayall wearing Adolf's comedy clothes.</p>

<p>Does this make you suspicious?</p>

<h3 id="a005001">the end of pragmatics</h3>

<p>As I often do, I was explaining pragmatics to some of the guests at our barbie. I used the 'central question' technique, where you describe your field by saying what the big question is you're trying to answer. I said something like:</p>

<blockquote><p><cite>...it's about how you work out exactly what someone is trying to get at when they say something in a particular context.</cite> </p></blockquote>

<p>David replied, <cite>'Oh well, it's a nod and a wink, isn't it?'</cite></p>

<p>Problem solved. Now I can retire in peace.</p>

<h3 id="a005000">more than a motor car (just make sure it doesn't land on a cyclist)</h3>

<p>Yes, we went to see <a href="http://www.chittythemusical.co.uk">Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</a> last night - yet another birthday treat. It was great fun. Sets and car and gadgets and stuff amazing. Music great. Acting really good (Michael Ball was ill but nobody cared). The one let-down was the choreography, which was good in some places but sometimes seemed kind of flat (a good gauge is to count the number of nodding grown-up heads around you).</p>

<p>It was really good to see Richard <span class="caps">O'B</span>rien performing (as the childcatcher). He's still got this amazing presence as soon as he steps onto the stage.</p>

<p>Bruce Willis was there with one of his kids. I'm off to find out which kid and then tell <a href="http://www.popbitch.com">popbitch</a></p>

<h3 id="a004999">lock them up</h3>

<p> I once heard Richard, of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0330377175/kinetics- 21/202-7726706-5012614">Richard's 21st Century Bicycle Book</a>fame, say that drivers in Holland are automatically chucked in the slammer for a few days whenever they hit a cyclist, no matter who's at fault.</p>

<p>Not sure if it's true, but it makes sense several times a day when I'm out on the bike.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_2097000/2097872.stm"> This</a> is about insurance companies maybe adopting the groovy European idea of putting the blame on car drivers every time they're involved in an accident with a cyclist or pedestrian.</p>

<h3 id="a004996">fuller report</h3>

<p>Didn't see much of the acts as I had to serve beer and we weren't that close, visually or aurally speaking. The Coral (at last) were pretty good, but a bit patchy. Then again, it's really hard to be the first act at a one-day, open-air thing. Adjectives I'd use include: playful, retro, unpredictable, jazzy (occasionally, and not in a good sense, I'm afraid). But definite potential overall.</p>

<p>Oasis were OK in a kind of old-fashioned rock kind of way, but I was also getting added vicarious enjoyment because I knew my 14-year old neighbour was bouncing around somewhere in the crowd.</p>

<p>Whoever was filming everything for the big screens on each side of the stage did an incredible job. It had that digital 'Hollyoaks' look and all sorts of fancy editing, slomo, etc. going on. I assume it'll be on telly one day.</p>

<p>Black Rebel Motorcycle Club were absolutely awesome in a kind of old-fashioned rock kind of way. I'm not sure they make the kind of records (OK, CDs) I would actually buy, but they are amazing musicians and performers. No interesting talk between songs or anything, but that seems to fit with what they do.</p>

<p>Next year, I'm going to see if I can get back to Glastonbury (haven't been since my legendary appearances in 1986 and 1987)</p>

<h3 id="a004994">the Finsbury Park experience</h3>

<p>If anyone is jealous of the Finsbury Park locals who get free concerts in their back gardens all summer long, xfm are broadcasting the whole of the sets by <span class="caps">BRMC, </span>the Charlatans and Oasis from 5pm today.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.xfm.co.uk"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/xfm.gif" alt="xfm online" width="115" height="66" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>I'm not really convinced that listening on the radio is that much fun, but apparently there were some interesting between-song comments on the first night. They paid tribute to John Entwistle and picked on one member of the audience: Stuart Bailie, the journalist, who they blamed for building up the Blur vs Oasis thing and threatened with immediate death. I don't really recall the Gallaghers trying to play down the Blur vs Oasis thing at the time though, do you?</p>

<h3 id="a004993">hoping for the Coral</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.thecoral.co.uk"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/coralpark.jpg" alt="not sure if this is the right park" width="240" height="315" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>Everyone round here's been listening to Oasis for the last couple of days, as the sound from their Finsbury Park concert rolls up the hill. On Friday, it was really loud. Apparently, you could make out every word from as far away as Wood Green.</p>

<p>We had a barbie yesterday and people took turns going up the climbing frame for a better sound. The Black Rebel Motorcycle Club really filled the garden until some flymo/strimmer/something started whining somewhere nearby.</p>

<p>Anyway, today the Workers Beer Company and the Woodcraft Folk have combined to arrange for me to get in free in exchange for a bit of beer serving. The Coral are the first band on so I'm hoping I finally get to see them.</p>

<p>Here's what Tony Naylor said about their EP in <a href="http://www.nme.com/reviews/10349.htm">an <span class="caps">NME </span>review</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><cite> Proving, once again, that an adolescence spent getting out of it on Pink Floyd is actually a surprisingly good creative catalyst, the 'Skeleton Key' EP makes very little sense in a pretty entertaining way. The lead track is Captain Beefheart fronting an Algerian folk band, rounded off, naturally, with a jazz-funk coda. Conversely, two tracks later, frayed acoustic lament 'Darkness' is lilting simplicity itself. <br /><br /> It's baffling that anyone thinks The Coral are potentially A Big Band, but they're already shaping up for an <span class="caps">SFA</span>-style career of infernal oddball jams/irresistibly beautiful pop songs that leave a niggling doubt at the back of your mind that, actually, they're just taking the piss. Which probably isn't a bad thing at all.</cite> </p></blockquote>

<p>Sounds good to me. I'll tell you later what they're like on a rainy afternoon in a London park.</p>

<h3 id="a004991">do you know niku jaga?</h3>

<p>Aki, who's from Osaka, moved in on Sunday and we have been communicating as well as can be expected ever since. When I was making stovies, she asked me <cite>'Do you know niku jaga?'</cite> I was a bit perplexed, as I thought she was asking me whether I knew Mick Jagger (I don't know him, but I believe I have only one degree of separation from him).</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p>Actually, I don't know how to count. If you actually know someone, is that no degrees or one degree? And why do bacon numbers only apply to American films? Is there a derived form for people in British films?</p>

<p><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/chomsky.gif" alt="Woody Allen" width="93" height="67" border="0" /></p>

<p>A good place to read Chomsky's political work is the <a href="http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/index.cfm">Noam Chomsky Archive</a> which is hosted by <a href="http://www.zmag.org">ZNet</a></p>

<p>And <a href="http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/www/chomsky.home.html">here</a> is his home page.</p>

<h3 id="a004988">at loon spiks</h3>

<p>Just been talking to Alec about attitudes to dialects and things. He reminded me that people in Aberdeen will refer to people who talk 'posh' (i.e. English-sounding) by saying something like:</p>

<blockquote><p><cite>at loon spiks</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<p><cite>at loon talks</cite></p>

<p>('at' means 'that' and 'loon' means 'boy') </p>

<p>It must do wonders for the self-esteem of Buchan/Doric speakers to think that what they are doing when noises come out of their mouth doesn't count as speaking or talking.</p>

<p>(This all started from talking about the tragedy that is Ewan MacGregor's performance as Obi Wan Kenobi, btw)</p>

<p>Ohna's birthday yesterday. Apoa gave her the Belle and Sebastian album, which is my favourite of her gifts. Well, apart from the ceilidh that <a href="http://www.woodcraft.org.uk">the Woodcraft Folk</a> so kindly put on for her.</p>

<p>The album is great. Damn and blast those reviewers with their misleadingly lukewarm comments!</p>

<p>Sarah, the cover star on the left, was a student at Middlesex and ended up on the cutting room floor (metaphorically) of a video I made there. Our sound person was ill and no-one noticed the big noisy fan above the heads of the actors. Luckily, the scene she was in was totally unnecessary and needed to be excised anyway.</p>

<p>Those kind xfm people gave me free tickets to go to the <span class="caps">NFT </span>last night and see <cite>Shellshock Rock</cite>, a 24-year old documentary about punk rock in Belfast. I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed such things as <cite>'Big Time'</cite> by Rudi. Ah, youth! And ah, the enthusiasm of Terri Hooley! He was the manager of Good Vibrations records. It was great to see him raving about how excited he was by it all, sticking on <cite>Big Time</cite> and then pogoing like a mad thing while sticking the Vs up at the camera.</p>

<p>The director, John T. Davis, introduced it and revealed a guilty secret about getting his film processed along with the day's news bulletins, by slipping it to the editors at the tv stations in the days when all the news items were on film.</p>

<p>Also enjoyed the Ed Wood-like attitude of The Outcasts recording <cite>You're A Disease</cite>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Take one ends.</p></blockquote>

<p>Pause.</p>

<p>'OK. That'll do. Now we'll try <cite>Frustration</cite>' </p>

<p>Good site on The Outcasts is <a href="http://punkandoi.free.fr/outcasts_biography.htm">here</a></p>

<p>This was part of the <span class="caps">NFT'</span>s nearly over <cite>'Never Mind The Jubilee'</cite> season, btw</p>

<h3 id="a004972">prepositions</h3>

<p>Just read the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,444692 9,00.html">Guardian obituary of Klaus Meyer</a>. I know almost nothing about him but now I wish I did. I especially like the sound of this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Prepositions (1987) ... an enchanting series in which English prepositions enact their meanings in frolics with abstract shapes and colours. </p></blockquote>

<p>I'm off to hunt down some of his work now.</p>

<h3 id="a004971">harmony and dischord</h3>

<p>Went to see Apoa playing guitar with lots of kids from the local music scheme yesterday. A joyous celebration of the musical achievements of the kids. Plus a pretty scary outburst of road rage among the parents in the car park on the way in.</p>

<p>Me and Ohna tried the <span class="caps">NYC </span>cyclists' stop-and-look routine. Not sure if it worked, but nobody died and we all went on to admire the harmony inside the hall.</p>

<h3 id="a004966">no coral</h3>

<p>Nice walk through the woods to the gig, using dug's <span class="caps">GPS </span>to make sure we didn't get lost.</p>

<p>The gig was very nice. A small crowd in a small field with a couple of small tents selling small bites and drinks. A small (i.e. young) support group and then a small set from Pulp. They were really good, even though no-one else seemed to have heard the rumour that they're splitting up.</p>

<p>Disappointingly, The Coral had cancelled so we'll have to keep eyes peeled for next time they're playing around here.</p>

<p>There were forest rangers, lots of marshals and traditional old bobbies with pointy hats. No misbehaviour of any kind. Toilets were as clean at the end of the evening as they were at the start and there was hardly even a queue. I have to say, it all seemed a bit twee compared to the kind of thing you get in Finsbury Park. I guess that's what the countryside is like?</p>

<p>We were very grateful for a lift back to our <span class="caps">B&amp;B </span>from Ian and Pauline. Not sure if we were fit to operate the <span class="caps">GPS </span>by then.</p>

<h3 id="a004965">pulp in the forest</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.pulponline.com"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/pulp.gif" alt="pulp people" width="135" height="42" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>Off to see Pulp in Thetford Forest in Suffolk tomorrow. Seems like everyone's playing Pulp at the moment, including our very nice minicab driver last night. Not only was he pleasant and willing to follow whatever route we wanted to follow, he was also listening to a rather nice compilaton tape of people like the Stone Roses, the Smiths, Oasis, and Pulp. Not only that, his choices were a bit unpredictable - <cite>Slide Away</cite> by Oasis, and <cite>Sunrise</cite> by Pulp, which is the jazzy last track on <cite>We Love Life</cite>.</p>

<p>Looking forward to the concert, and also excited to discover that one of the support acts is The Coral. I've been snooping around <a href="http://www.thecoral.co.uk">their website</a> and other links and have discovered that they make some seriously groovy music. As often, <a href="http://www.nme.com/artists/109557.htm">the <span class="caps">NME'</span>s artist page for The Coral</a> is one of the best sites about them.</p>

<h3 id="a004964">House of Magic</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/butler.jpg" alt="the butler" width="126" height="126" border="0" /></p>

<p>Had an unusual time in <cite>'a secret location'</cite> last night. <a href="http://www.houseofmagic.co.uk">Simon Drake's House of Magic</a> is <cite>'somewhere in London'</cite>. It's a large house with lots of unusual spooky features. You have magicians doing tricks dotted around the house, lots of weird stuff to look at, and a haunted cellar to take a tour of. Later on, there's a magic show. The highlight of the magic show was the poor sod who had his head sawn off. He looked genuinely freaked out after it had been magically stuck on again.</p>

<p>They're not too precious about pretending it's real magic. The ghost in the cellar was happy to say <cite>'don't touch the wires'</cite> and the card sharp refused to repeat a trick, since we'd <cite>'know what to look for if I do it again'</cite>.</p>

<p>I hope the magicians aren't offended if I say that the most popular attraction with our crowd was the Addams Family pinball machine, complete with a hand in a box that would claim the ball every now and then.</p>

<p>Dear Google,</p>

<p>In case you don't know, I just wanted to tell you that the academics of the world are in love with you right now, thanks to the efficiency of your 'advanced search' function.</p>

<p>There's a buzz in the universities about the way that it allows academics to find sources which students have taken from the web and incorporated in their courseworks without acknowledgement.</p>

<p>The dons are delighted that one type of plagiarism is now very easy to detect. I don't suppose you can add a 'search print only' option, can you?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.gbv.com/">Guided By Voices website</a> is one of the best artiste sites (let's face it, some of them are well dodgy). They bung loads of stuff on there, including chords for their songs, which is really cool, streaming e-cards, etc. etc.</p>

<h3 id="a004959">backside in the bacon slicer</h3>

<p>I'm always collecting interesting examples of verbal behaviour, and the World Cup is a rich source of data. I've noticed that <cite>they're gonna hurt you</cite> has become a catchphrase among the pundits these days. And I'm going to spontaneously combust next time Bobby Robson continues his <cite>that's the Xth player I've bought this summer</cite> running gag.</p>

<p>My favourite recent expression was Mick McCarthy who was asked about his reactions from the dugout watching Ireland and said that it was one thing watching at home, or even playing, but that <cite>when you're the one sat there with your backside in the bacon slicer</cite> it's a different story. He's a master of metaphor as well as man management.</p>

<p>Let me know if you come across any other groovy examples.</p>

<h3 id="a004958">star wars conversation</h3>

<p>John sent a message to tell me about filmfour's <a href="http://www.filmfour.com/forceometer">forceometer</a>. I liked Edward's replies:</p>

<blockquote><p>John: This one's a bit lame, but worth it for the sound effects and the final assessment.</p></blockquote>

<p>Edward: Like the films, then.</p>

<p>John: And you get to make up your own name.</p>

<p>Edward: That sounds like a pretty dark side thing to do to me.</p>

<p>John: The Force-o-meter on FilmFour.com has calculated that Darth Johnny is a virtual <span class="caps">HAN SOLO.</span> Find out whether you are drawn to the dark or light side of the force at http://www.filmfour.com/forceometer</p>

<p>Edward: Yoda is my best mate, apparently. Bollocks, he talks. </p>

<p>The quiz was a bit dull. The questions are a bit boring, the point of each one is too obvious and they go on forever before you get to the assessment at the end. But yes, the sound effects and the assessment are good. I'm Luke Skywalker. The force is strong with me. My father is evil, I fancy my sister and my face is kinda wonky, but nevertheless I have mastered my dark side. <cite>You are who you pretend to be</cite>, as they say ;-)</p>

<p>As I type this I'm listening to Joy Division's <cite>Digital</cite> (the one that goes 'I feel it closing in, day in day out') being performed by New Order in the park at the bottom of the road. They've played a number of Joy Division songs tonight, including <cite>Love Will Tear Us Apart</cite> and <cite>Transmission</cite> but the most special one for me was a New Order song: <cite>Temptation</cite>. It reminded me of a few weeks ago when we gatecrashed a party across the road and as we danced to <cite>Temptation</cite>, Alan exclaimed that:</p>

<blockquote><p>for a whole year of my life, <span class="caps">NOTHING </span>was more important than this song </p></blockquote>

<h3 id="a004949">whose clones?</h3>

<p> Just went to see <cite>Attack of the Clones</cite>. I spent half an hour afterwards explaining it to the two 9 year olds I brought with me. Don't want to spoil the ending for anyone who hasn't seen it (is there anyone?), but neither of them had come close to understanding just how serious the situation was at the end. If you are taking kids, I recommend they spend a few days watching the Parliament Channel and a few episodes of Newsnight before going to see it.</p>

<p>Maybe the whole thing is a complicated exercise in irony based on resemblances between kids in the audience and the members of the senate who cheer happily as they hand over those 'temporary special powers'? (Thanks, Jar Jar).</p>

<p>writing and crunching through some numbers from a series of experiments. Not sure whether to admit that this is partly because I don't want to take a day off in recognition of some birthday or other. 20 years ago, me and my work colleagues insisted on working (in The Other Record Shop - a now legendary ex-establishment in Aberdeen) on the day that Charles and Diana got married. They made us do some stock-taking, since nobody was around trying to buy records.</p>

<p>The thing is, I hope I'm working through apathy, which is the real opposite of love. I was reminded that 'love and hate are two sides of the same coin' when I read <a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3820/sexual_tension.html">this story about sexual tension coming to the boil in Jerusalem</a></p>

<h3 id="a004945">senegal</h3>

<p>Another reason to love Senegal is because of the music they produce there.</p>

<p>Youssou <span class="caps">N'D</span>our's 'site officiel' <cite>ne marche pas en ce moment</cite>, but here's a link to a relevant site:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.afropop.org/explore/show_artist/ID/43"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/youssoundour.jpg" alt="Youssou" width="250" height="250" /></a></p>

<p>And this is a truly wonderful CD:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000DD9W/qid=1022894181/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_0_1/026-2391722-3246062"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/musicinmyhead.jpg" alt="Music In My Head" width="130" height="130" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>It's the soundtrack to a novel, which is quite a cool concept. The CD is great. The most amazing track on it is the one with a 17 year old Youssou screaming his head off. Bien recommendee. B-)</p>

<h3 id="a004938">it's a losing battle</h3>

<p>but I'm glad someone's fighting it. You can read <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992335" >here</a> about a new attempt to keep the government's nose out of our beeswax.</p>

<p>It seems ironic after watching <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/microsites/M/mark_thomas/in dex.html">Mark Thomas</a> trying to stick his nose (our nose?) into the government's beeswax last night. My favourite bit was when he asked an MoD policewoman where the Burlington Bunker was. She said that there was no such thing, that was just a phrase that gets 'bandied about'. It turned out that there was no such thing as the 'Burlington bunker' but there was a complex of underground tunnels and things that they don't refer to by that oft-bandied phrase. She did have a sense of humour about it all, though.</p>

<p>btw, does anyone know the story behind the sign we saw out in Essex which points the way to the <cite>Secret Nuclear Bunker</cite>? It's just one more option on a big green roundabout directions sign.</p>

<h3 id="a004935">more tender lullabies please</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/eminem.jpg" alt="I'm out the closet" width="100" height="134" border="0" /></p>

<p>Well, at least the <a href="http://www.nme.com/reviews/10572.htm"><span class="caps">NME</span></a> liked Eminem's album. Grownup reviewers seem to think he's gone downhill, so I'm kind of pleased that someone likes it. The <span class="caps">NME </span>reviewer's ingredients list is:</p>

<blockquote><p>This album was made from: </p></blockquote>

<p>Legal difficulties: 36% Misogynous rage: 30% Southern-style bounce: 22% Post-September 11 politics: 15% Aerosmith samples: 5% Tender lullabies: 2% </p>

<p>They certainly got it right when they reviewed <cite>the Slim Shady LP</cite>. Their verdict:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you're retarded, stoned or 12, you're going to absolutely love it. </p></blockquote>

<p>I must admit, one of the best things about eminem is that you can really irritate 12-year-old boys by telling them how much you like him.</p>

<h3 id="a004934">shore to ship</h3>

<p>And meanwhile, Dug's mum and dad are cruising off the coast of Norway. They phone us every now and then to see if there's any news. We have their shore-to-ship number so we can pass anything on.</p>

<p>Hope Ruth's coping with the tension. When we finally gave birth, Ruth was so anxious she passed out in the hospital and spent the best part of a day in casualty.</p>

<h3 id="a004933">freaking out</h3>

<p> Nicki has been in labour since Monday morning, which means, of course, that Dug has been in co-labour since then.</p>

<p>We're all obsessively checking Dug's blog to keep up with developments.</p>

<p>It's the kind of obsessive state that the phrase "beside yourself" is made for. There's part of me here, there and wherever and part of me permanently thinking about <span class="caps">D&amp;N </span>and wondering how it's going for them.</p>

<p>As well as thinking of them, it also brings back the first time Ohna and I went through the giving birth thing. And it's also got me thinking about other people and their birth experiences (Peter and Marina, Hans and Villy, etc. etc.)</p>

<p>They are going to be two very tired parents by the time they get home to start dealing with those sleepless nights ...</p>

<h3 id="a004931">Reservoir Dogs</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0240516362/qid= 1022675047/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_2_1/202-8255745-4860661"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/elliotsbook.jpg" alt="sell the hot screenplay" width="93" height="140" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>In <cite>raindance writers' lab: write + sell the hot screenplay</cite>, which is a pretty good book about how to write and sell the hot screenplay (exactly what it says on the tin), Elliot Grove says:</p>

<blockquote><p><cite>Reservoir Dogs</cite> had a very different meaning for us farmboys growing up in America. You city slickers, or Europeans, probably thought that this title was a cutesy arty title. And it is. But to me it had a different meaning which summed up the movie in two words.</p></blockquote>

<p>As a kid we were told never to go into a dry reservoir. They did a lot of open quarry mining for gravel near where I grew up. There were two types of quarries - some quarries would hit a spring and fill up with water. We used to dive off the sides of these in the summer. Other quarries were dry quarries. There would just be a puddle in the bottom after a rain shower. Dogs and rats would fall down into the quarry, and be unable to get up. The only way they could survive was by eating each other. And every summer there would be a sad story about some kid who went down into a dry quarry and was ripped to shreds. Knowing that now, isn't that the story of <cite>Reservoir Dogs</cite>? </p>

<h3 id="a004930">writing lessons</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/surfer.gif" alt = "Kirby rules" width="210" height="183" border="5" /></p>

<p>Just watched <cite>Crimson Tide</cite> on the advice of Lawrence, who's been helping me with a radio play what I wrote. Apparently, Quentin Tarantino helped with the dialogue, 'spicing up' the characters with such things as (surprise) references to popular culture. It worked. Some of the best moments were when Denzel Washington explained things to his crew by referring to Star Trek, the Silver Surfer and so on.</p>

<p>But the real lesson for aspiring screenwriters is the way they generate and handle the central conflict between the Captain (Gene Hackman) and his 'XO', i.e. Executive Officer (Denzel Washington). Both of them have around the same amount of irritating traits and both make around the same number of 'wrong' decisions (that's wrong if you want to be friends, but right if you want to be the subject of a screenplay). So you can see both sides of the argument, and feel involved by being a bit annoyed by each of them.</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p>PS You can tell the acting was pretty good because it's one of the few occasions where Gene Hackman's performance doesn't stand out as miles better than the rest of the cast.</p>

<p><span class="caps">PPS</span> Kirby's Silver Surfer rules ;-)</p>

<p><span class="caps">PPPS</span> As an experiment, picture Denzel Washington acting. Do you see what I see? We have a theory that he's one of a group of actors with a trademark expression. With Denzel, it's that kind of wide-eyed, suppressed anger look. I wonder if he's insured it?</p>

<p><span class="caps">PPPPS</span> Do you want to know why Reservoir Dogs is called Reservoir Dogs? I'll tell you tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="a004928">language from nothing</h3>

<p>Just re-viewed the Horizon documentary about the emergence of Nicaraguan Sign Language. It's a fascinating story, about how kids in Nicaragua invented a new language. It happened after the Sandinistas brought deaf kids together for education after the revolution. Before the revolution, education was less of a priority and deaf folk were fairly isolated, communicating with basic gestures. When they were brought together, they communicated through an ad hoc gesture system, like a pidgin language. The younger kids quickly developed a full language based on these gestures. This is what linguists call 'creolisation'. The linguist who did most of the work on this is Judy Kegl, from the University of Southern Maine. <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/nuggets/028/nugget.htm">Here</a> is an article about it all (with links to other good sites).</p>

<p>What's really amazing, though, is that it seems pretty much all kids invent their first language rather than just learning the language of the grownups around them. <a href="http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/rbeard/acquisition.html">Read about it here</a></p>

<p>There are some really good web resources on sign language.</p>

<p>This is a good resource for British Sign Language (BSL): <a href="http://www.british-sign.co.uk">http://www.british-sign.co.uk</a></p>

<p>This is a good one for American Sign Language (ASL): <a href="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb">http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb</a></p>

<p>And this is just a good one: <a href="http://www.handspeak.com">http://www.handspeak.com</a></p>

<p>Signstream &#8482; is a really good use of web technology. It's a database for showing annotated videos of signing: <a href="http://www.bu.edu/asllrp/SignStream/">http://www.bu.edu/asllrp/SignStream</a></p>

<p>I could go on, but the last thing I'll tell you about for now is a really good monthly magazine for linguists, called Glot International: <a href="http://www.glotinternational.com/geninfo.htm">http://www.glotinternational.com/geninfo.htm</a></p>

<p>A recent issue of glot contained this fascinating article (in pdf format) by Neil Smith: <a href="http://www.glotinternational.com/PDF/vol5/5.3/Glo017.pdf">Singing By The Dead</a></p>

<h3 id="a004925">swarm intelligence</h3>

<p> Another good piece by Ben Hammersley in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4418820,00.html ">Guardian</a> yesterday. <cite>Swarm intelligence</cite> refers to the collective intelligence of a group of, say, ants as opposed to the individual lack of intelligence in one ant, an idea that's being used more and more in developing web and other technology. It's one of those ideas that's really obvious after someone's pointed it out to you and has a lot in common with <a href="http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~philos/MindDict/connectionism.html" >connectionism</a></p>

<p>One thing that interests me about this kind of thing is the gap that still remains between the activity of the ants/neurons/whatever at brain level and whatever's going on at mind level. Us linguistics folk tend to operate at mind level while assuming that one day we'll explain how it all relates to brain level. But so far, we don't really know exactly how to connect the two.</p>

<h3 id="a004924">more puzzles</h3>

<p>For those of you still struggling, the coded message in the earlier posting is:</p>

<blockquote><p>Spooks is fun</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm enjoying this so much that:</p>

<p>I might be some time </p>

<p>If you have a devious mind, and you want to try more puzzles like this, you could try:</p>

<p>If you play this one, you won't save the world but you might end up working for her majesty's government</p>

<p>Another option is to visit:</p>

<h3 id="a004923">a clue</h3>

<p>To help you decode the last message, here's a clue:</p>

<blockquote><p>If I'd wanted to spell my name in this code, it would have come out as: aaaaa ;-) </p></blockquote>

<p>If you're interested in cryptography at all, the best book on the subject is The Code Book by Simon Singh.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/codebook.jpg" alt="The Code Book" width="92" height="140" border="0" hspace="15" /></p>

<p>A good site for introducing cryptography (aimed at kids but I like playing with it) is:</p>

<h3 id="a004921">games with brains</h3>

<p>I've finally managed to have a look at <a href="http://www.thameshouse.net/">thameshouse</a>, where a new game has begun based on the tv series <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/spooks/">Spooks</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thameshouse.net/"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/thameshousebanner_logo.gif" alt="UK Security Service Extranet" width="148" height="88" border="0" hspace ="15" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>It's very much my kind of game, since it's based on cryptic puzzles and deviousness rather than just killing people or taking free kicks (which seems to be the latest pre-world cup craze).</p>

<p>I'm off to have a look.</p>

<p>Will report back later (possibly in code)</p>

<h3 id="a004920">Acme Novelty Library</h3>

<p>Just saw this in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4417164,00.html ">the Guardian</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The third degree</p></blockquote>

<p>At last hard-pressed modern languages departments have cause to cheer. Last week an impressive role model appeared to aid student recruitment in the shape of Margaret MacDonald, the enterprising madam running a massive vice-ring with the aid of a few mobile phones, a website - and fluency in six languages. A graduate of the Polytechnic of Central London (now Westminster University) and Reims management school, she impressed the arresting Paris police with her business and linguistic ability. "Whenever she is in Paris she goes to evening classes at the Sorbonne to perfect her Greek, Japanese and Arabic," a source told the Guardian. Enormous sums are believed to lie in her offshore bank accounts. Expect to see language courses surprisingly popular during Clearing this summer. </p>

<p>What is it about languages and linguistics? God know, VCs don't think they're sexy...</p>

<h3 id="a004917">free comic</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.fantagraphics.com">Fantagraphics</a> are the publishers of the truly magnificent <em>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid On Earth</em> by Chris Ware (read it if you haven't already):</p>

<p><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/jimmycorrigan.jpg" alt="I sat across from you for SIX MONTHS and you never ONCE noticed me. GOODBYE." width="128" height="128" border="0" hspace = "15" /></p>

<p>They've also made <a href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/comics/comics.html">this </a> available free:</p>

<p>You have to download it one page at a time and there are 24 of them, but it's pretty good. It's called <em>Blank State</em> and it's by Alex Fellows.</p>

<p>I particularly liked the response to the chain email which you can find on <a href=" http://www.fantagraphics.com/comics/blankslate/b06.html">page 6</a> (be warned that it contains rude words, though)</p>

<p> They're mad. I don't understand but I truly admire the project that the <a href="http://www.textarc.org/"/>Textarc</a> people are working on. I don't know how to summarise it properly, but it's kind of like a computer reading a book and writing it on screen in a big circle with concordancing, representations of associations, and stuff like that appearing as it goes.

<h2>May 15, 2002</h2>


<h3 id="a004915">Exterminate all rational thought</h3>

<p>Here's the start of a recently written essay (thanks to Fabio for showing it to me):</p>

<blockquote><p>Postcultural objectivism and modernism</p></blockquote>

<p>John Y. Wilson</p>

<p>Department of Politics, University of California</p>

<p>1. Dialectic desublimation and the precultural paradigm of expression</p>

<p>The characteristic theme of the works of Rushdie is the role of the participant as writer. It could be said that if capitalist discourse holds, the works of Rushdie are an example of self-fulfilling nationalism.</p>

<p>The primary theme of Sargeant's<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://blogs.mtengine.com/billy/life-of-billy/index.html#fn1">1</a></sup> analysis of postcultural objectivism is not conceptualism per se, but preconceptualism. Therefore, Lyotard uses the term 'postcultural theory' to denote the role of the artist as participant. </p>

<p>What do you think? Not bad, considering it was randomly generated by <a href="http://www.elsewhere.org/cgi-bin/postmodern">the Postmodern generator</a> using <a href="http://dev.null.org/dadaengine/"/>the Dada Engine</a></p>

<p>It's simple but effective. They also do other genres. <a href="http://www.elsewhere.org/hbzpoetry/"/>Adolescent poetry </a>is worth a look.</p>

<p>It reminds me of the <a href="http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/"/>Social Text Affair</a> where the physicist Alan Sokal decided to run an experiment to explore the question:</p>

<blockquote><p>Would a leading North American journal of cultural studies -- whose editorial collective includes such luminaries as Fredric Jameson and Andrew Ross -- publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions? </p></blockquote>

<p>No doubt you'll be shocked to discover that the answer turned out to be yes. Sokal's account of what he did is <a href="http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html" />here</a></p>

<h3 id="a004914">Call yourselves punks?</h3>

<p> The <a href="http://www.nme.com"/>nme</a> just reviewed the new album by <a href="http://www.hundredreasons.com"/>Hundred Reasons </a> (a website that needs some work, imho, but they are relaunching on the 20th, so we'll see). You can read the review <a href="http://www.nme.com/reviews/10528.htm"/>here</a>. Apparently, it's punk. They mention the well-known truism that <em>punk rock is ours, it owes us a living</em>, and the closing comment is:</p>

<blockquote><p>Here's what they can do with five-and-a-half chords and a will of iron - now it's your turn </p></blockquote>

<p>I'm sorry, but if you want to do punk rock, that's at least two-and-a-half chords too many B-)</p>

<p>I haven't heard the record but I did see Hundred Reasons live and would thoroughly recommend them. They're long, they're thin, they're loud. What more could you want?</p>

<h3 id="a004913">Does this flag look familiar?</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/flag2.gif" alt="familiar flag" width="160" height="114" border="0" hspace = "15" /></p>

<p>I thought I might post a gratuitous flag to complement Rem Koolhaas's design (see earlier posting) so I looked up this old <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/galleryguide/0,6191,184378,00.html"/> Guardian article </a> about new designs for the Union Jack. If you visit this site, you'll see what professional designers came up with, and you can link to suggestions from ordinary folk. One of the ordinary folk, Justin Ginetti, sent the above. He deserves some credit for the flag, but he should probably be sent off to 'Pseuds' Corner' or the <a href="http://www.plainenglish.co.uk"/>Plain English</a> campaign for coming up with this comment on his work:</p>

<blockquote><p>This "flag" image is art object cum ironic nationalist symbol. On the one hand, the vertical lines recall the work of Barnett Newman; they also call to mind those ubiquitous bar codes and the bands of genes on chromosomes. The red and blue "bars" also suggest prison bars reflecting the different cultural tolerances/attitudes about nationalist or imperial agendas. The white spaces in between the red and blue bars explicitly signify the unbalanced and tenuous status of nationalist icons. I think the cumulative effect of the image tends to destabilise the hegemonic weight of tradition - even inevitability - which the Union Jack conjures up in this post-colonial era. This image is a veritable reordering of that which was. </p></blockquote>

<h3 id="a004911">The Monarch's Management Speak</h3>

<p>You must know about <a href="http://www.thefridaything.co.uk">The Friday Thing </a> In case you don't, it's a weekly email which you pay ten pounds a year to receive. I've been finding that it gives me more than my money's worth, even though I might not recommend it to my more faint-hearted friends.</p>

<p>Anyway, following up our recent discussion inspired by David Blunkett's linguistic shamelessness, here is what tft have to say about a new development in the linguistic behaviour of a certain resident of <span class="caps">SW1</span>:</p>

<blockquote><p>'CHANGE IS <span class="caps">THE ONLY CONSTANT' SHOCKER</span></p></blockquote>

<p>This week the Queen said: 'Change has become a constant. Managing it has become an expanding discipline.'</p>

<p>Apart from the sheer vacuity of the statement, it's a sign that management speak has permeated into every bastion of life. Once the preserve of, er, management, management speak can now be found in schools, the army and even the monarchy.</p>

<p>Where management speak originates from is unclear. The language is taken from other areas of life - but primarily the military and scientific worlds, see 'strategy' and 'paradigm shift'. Some of it is just misappropriated ('synergy', 'rationalise' etc.) and some of it is simply made up ('downsizing', 'pro-active' etc.)</p>

<p>Given that management speak first became prevalent in the <span class="caps">US, </span>it seems likely it originated in business schools there, and has gradually migrated to the <span class="caps">UK.</span> As with all jargon, management speak is fundamentally a way of making its speaker sound more knowledgeable, and privy to some expert information. Its other purpose is to obscure meaning. In business, the phrase 'manufacturing facility', or some variant, has largely replaced the word 'factory'. Why?</p>

<p>What's misguided about this banal attempt at deception is that it's so transparent. Whether you call it a facility or a factory, if you go inside a noisy, dirty factory/facility full of greasy machine tools and heavy machinery, it's obviously a factory.</p>

<p>Business abounds with this drivel. The sheer thoughtlessness of it is evident in phrases like 'human resources', which means 'staff' or, more simply, 'employees'. In this case an uncontroversial word like 'employee' has been replaced with a phrase that suggests people are resources just like iron ore or natural gas. </p>

<p>You can read the full text of the speech at <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page1126.asp"> Brenda's homepage </a></p>

<p>I could go on about this management speak mullarkey, but I'll save it for now, except to point out that the <a href="http://www.dack.com/web/bullshit.html"> Web Economy Bullshit Generator </a> would be great if it worked a wee bit better. As it stands, it gives good gobbledy-gook but the output doesn't always have much to do with the input.</p>

<p> B-)</p>

<h2>May  9, 2002</h2>


<h3 id="a004910">goodbye groovy flag B-(</h3>

<p> I went to the Foreign Office today. They were having an open day to celebrate 'Europe Day'. (That Gilbert Scott didn't do things by halves, did he?)</p>

<p>There were people from European states with info on this, that and the other. I picked up materials on Denmark for my soon-to-be-a-dad brother-in-law, Dug, who's currently investigating his Danish ancestry. The Czech Republic were by far the most popular state. Not only did they have two stalls but they were dishing out bottles of Budwar and loads of food. You couldn't get near their stall.</p>

<p>Anyway, I asked people from the EU stalls (i.e. representing the Union in general rather than member states) about the groovy new flag (see last posting). None of them had seen it. In fact, they all started asking me questions about it. Then I found the EU Parliament stall where they pointed out that they were keeping their old 'stars' flag and handed me this Press Release (from a stack they had ready to give out):</p>

<blockquote><p>Contrary to a number of reports in the press, the European Union has no plans to replace the current 'gold star' design of its flag with a multi-coloured striped logo.</p></blockquote>

<p>The new design formed part of an independent report aimed at underlining the unique and different role of Brussels as the capital of the EU as well as Belgium. None of the illustrations and designs contained in the report were commissioned by the <span class="caps">EU.</span></p>

<p>The suggestion that the EU is being forced to redesign its flag as a result of the forthcoming enlargement of the Union is completely false. The number of stars on the current EU flag has never been representative of the number of the Member States. There are 12 stars on the flag and, currently, 15 member states. This number will not increase as the Union enlarges. </p>

<p>There. Now that's cleared up. Phew!</p>

<h3 id="a004907">psycle sluts</h3>

<p>People of a certain age are wallowing in a wave of nostalgia for those punky days at the moment (that's the first punk, starting in the UK around 1976, rather than the several later varieties), which is fine by me.</p>

<p>In the record shop today, I had a bit of an epiphany when they were playing one of the recent punk compliations and John Cooper Clarke started to tell me about:</p>

<blockquote><p>those pouting prima-donnas found within the swelling j. arthur ranks of the sexational psycle sluts </p></blockquote>

<p>It's that live version where you can hear the audience behind him. I'd forgotten how much I'd enjoyed him in those days.</p>

<p>If you want to read more about "those nubile nihilists of the north circular", or any of his poems, you can find them all at <a href = "http://www.cyberspike.com/clarke/poemlist.html">cyberspike</a></p>

<p>There's an interview (from 1996) at <a href = "http://www.idler.co.uk/html/interviews/interview17.htm">the Idler</a></p>

<p>And there's some fun stuff on <a href = "http://www.johncooperclarke.com"><span class="caps">JCC'</span>s own page</a></p>

<p>John has also tried his hand at that notoriously challenging form, the haiku:</p>

<h3 id="a004906">What is a weblog?</h3>

<p>Mio amico Peter il libero italiano (well, he lives there, at least) asked me what a weblog is. Here's one definition:</p>

<blockquote><p>A weblog (sometimes called a blog or a newspage or a filter) is a webpage where a weblogger (sometimes called a blogger, or a pre-surfer) 'logs' all the other webpages she finds interesting. </p></blockquote>

<p>That definition came from <a href = "http://www.robotwisdom.com/weblogs/"> robotwisdom </a> The best artists in any field are always trying to push back the boundaries, as you'll notice I've been doing here (where are all the links to webpages? what's all this waffle he's posting? why isn't Billy a she?). Anyway, for those of you made uncomfortable by the avant-garde, here are a couple of links to discussions about weblogs:</p>

<p><a href = "http://www.salon.com/tech/col/rose/1999/05/28/weblogs/"> Fear of Links</a></p>

<p><a href = "http://www.powazek.com/wtf/"> What the hell is a weblog and why won't they leave me alone?</a></p>

<p>By the way, did you know that:</p>

<blockquote><p>a hotdog was originally called 'a hot dachshund sausage sandwich', and was shortened to 'hot dog' by the boys that sold them at baseball games. The 'dachshund sausage' was simply a particular NY butcher's very successful variant of the well-known 'frankfurter', which had become a fixture at Coney Island. </p></blockquote>

<p>Grazie per questa informazione, Peter B-)</p>

<h3 id="a004905">Waxworm Redemption (or should that be Salvation?)</h3>

<p>Just been reading the screenplay for <cite>The Shawshank Redemption</cite>, one of the best screenplays you could read, which has already started to be used as an exemplar in some of the "how to write screenplays" books.</p>

<p> It's also one of the best publications of a screenplay, complete with words from Stephen King (who wrote the novella it's based on) and Frank Darabont (writer and director), explanations of changes from script to screen, storyboards and, most importantly, it's the unadjusted screenplay that was taken onto the set on the first day of shooting, rather than a polished-up version of what you actually ended up seeing.</p>

<p> I particularly enjoyed the bit about how the representative of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals revealed that she was there not only to protect the rights of the baby crow which Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore) keeps in his jacket pocket but also to look out for the maggot he feeds to the crow. Quoting Frank Darabont:</p>

<blockquote><p>she decreed that no live worm be fed to the bird. Only a dead one would do. One that died of natural causes. My suggestion that we have the maggot autopsied to determine cause of death drew nothing but a blank stare. Patiently explaining that the maggots were actually waxworms purchased by the prop department at a local bait shop also cut us no slack. Apparently, the God-given right of any fisherman to blithely feed a waxworm to a steelhead bass is denied the Hollywood filmmaker and his baby crow, even when the Clock of Doom is ticking off $120,000 a day in production costs. Thank God we found a dead waxworm in the batch, or we might still be there. <br /><br /> Before the day was out, our intrepid grips had presented us with a tiny director's chair made out of matchsticks, just in case any of the waxworms needed a breather between takes. </p></blockquote>

<p>God bless the human spirit, which has time to make a matchstick chair for a waxworm for the fun of it, even when the Clock of Doom is ticking at $120,000 a day!</p>

<h3 id="a004902">gloves off</h3>

<p>Thanks, dug. He started it.</p>

<p>In his second Today interview last week, he said that he didn't regret using the word <em>swamping</em> because the dictionary definition "is quite straightforward, and it is exactly the same as <em>overwhelm</em> or <em>overburden</em>, which is to be swamped with work, or overwhelmed with work". As someone said to me today, "why not just use <em>overwhelm</em> then, if it has exactly the same meaning?" And if people object, why not just say "OK, I mean <em>overhwelm</em>"? It seems that he is deliberately trying to establish a classically structuralist opposition between "people who chat" and "people I talk to".</p>

<p>Note also his use of the word "liberati" in the first interview.</p>

<p>PS I wonder how Blunkett would feel about the fact that this same person explained how she understood this way of using words by saying "it's the kind of thing Haider does in Austria"...</p>

<h3 id="a004900">"People Who Chat To Each Other"</h3>

<p>Here's the leader from the Guardian, last Friday, 26 April 2002:</p>

<p> Chattering classes <span class="caps">RIP </span>- The home secretary needs your help</p>

<p> During the course of his "swamping" interview on Radio 4 yesterday, David Blunkett coined a new phrase to describe the sort of soggy liberal who feels squeamish when the home secretary switches into his sub-Richard Littlejohn mode. Veering at the last second from using the tired cliche, "the chattering classes", he instead dismissed them as "people who chat to each other". </p>

<p> It is, we confess, not snappy. But it is a brave stab at coming up with a new, and much needed, piece of terminology. Once upon a time this group was known dismissively as "Hampstead intellectuals", until property prices in <span class="caps">NW3 </span>became a barrier for anyone whose salary was not at least 2,000 times their <span class="caps">IQ. </span>"Guardian readers" served tolerably well for a number of years, especially with any one of a number of well-loved prefixes. These included a) brown-sandal-wearing, b) muesli-eating, c) Citroen-driving, d) dungaree-wearing, e) tree-hugging and f) wispy-bearded. Bonus points could be scored for the additional use of one or more of: black, disabled, lesbian, save the whale, pinko, bicycling or social worker. </p>

<p> After a while, N1 replaced <span class="caps">NW3.</span> These Islingtonians no longer ate muesli while imparting their dripping wet opinions, but grazed instead on sun-dried tomatoes, often drizzled with balsamic vinegar, preferably in trendy wine bars. Given the prime minister's own roots in Islington, this stereotype was not without its own risks. Some felt more comfortable with the generic formula, "North London bien-pensants". </p>

<p> The chattering classes had a good run for their money, as did the politically correct brigade. Jack Straw rather more directly managed to infiltrate "liberal" as a straightforward term of abuse. And now, courtesy of his successor at the home office, we have "people who chat to each other". It is too early to say whether this will catch on. Readers with alternative suggestions might contact Mr Blunkett directly. It feels as if he's struggling a bit.</p>

<h3 id="a004899">Mistress Chloe is everywhere</h3>

<p>At the Woodcraft Camp at the weekend, the traditional adult campfire session was getting under way (kids now safely tucked up in their tents) and the conversation turned to Mistress Chloe, the dominatrix grammarian of Holloway Road (see earlier posting). The person who inititated this discussion wondered if anyone had heard of her. The campers were impressed and intrigued by my detailed knowledge. Seems she's becoming a bit of a 'meme' at the moment. I wonder if she's heard of viral marketing (or is she already indulging in some?)</p>

<h3 id="a004898">way to go?</h3>

<p>The first time I ever voted it was for Scottish Devolution in 1979. A majority of those who voted (51.6%) said "yes". But that meant "no" because the devolution Bill stated that 40% of the electorate had to say yes, which would have required something like two-thirds of those who voted saying "yes". It was the start of a miserable pattern of voting disappointment (see John <span class="caps">O'F</span>arrell's 'Things Can Only Get Better' for an amusingly miserable memoir of the period).</p>

<p>My best ever voting experience was when Ken Livingstone was elected Mayor of London (4 May 2000). On my way to work I cycled into the polling station (yes, they let me cycle into the polling station), voted for Ken and gave my other vote to the Greens, knowing not only that Ken was going to win but also that the Green vote would actually have some effect (there are now three Greens on the Greater London Assembly, out of a total of 25 seats). Oh, and the sun was shining.</p>

<p>On Thursday, it's local election day in London. I'm wondering if the Le Pen effect will lead to a larger than usual turnout, and I'm wondering whether to vote for the Labour candidates or not. One of them, Josie Irwin, has to get one of my votes as she has actually done something for local folk here - she took an active part in saving our local library. But you couldn't rave about the Labour performance more generally, could you? On the other hand, what are the chances of a monster raving tory getting in if we all get complacent?</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p><span class="caps">PS.</span> We have a Liberal Democrat candidate called Mark Thatcher - should I be worried?</p>

<p>My cat seems unaware of lexical ambiguity. It keeps attacking my computer's mouse</p>

<p>Mind you, it also attacks my modem cable. Could she just be going for anything that starts with an M and an O?</p>

<p>Actually, now I get it, it's conceptual overgeneralisation. She just attacks anything.</p>

<h3 id="a004895">weasel words (Is Blunkett Thatcher In Disguise?)</h3>

<p>I've never forgiven David Blunkett for his blatant linguistic truth evasion (= lying) about selection in schools. In case you've forgotten, at a Labour conference while they were still trying to get back into power, he boldly proclaimed, in classic political tub-thumping style: "Read my lips! No selection under a Labour government!" When they got in and confirmed that there would be selection under a Labour government, he spent a day trying out different ways of wriggling off the hook, and finally settled on "obviously, I was joking!" His tone, as it always is, was outraged and angry. There is no rocket science involved in looking at the video and determining that the idea that he was joking is nonsense.</p>

<p>His latest piece of applied linguistics follows his use of the word "swamping" when explaining that the government planned to segregate kids into special schools for asylum-seekers, to avoid "swamping" local schools. On the Today programme on the radio this week, he declared no regrets for having used the word, saying that any dictionary will tell you that "swamp" means "overwhelm" etc., i.e. he ignored the obvious negative connotations and denied the relevance of the allusion to Margaret Thatcher (she used to be Prime Minister, you know) who used the word in a much more inflammatory way referring to immigration in general.</p>

<p>Ignoring the appeal to naive assumptions about dictionaries and authority, which needs a whole seminar of its own, an interesting linguistic point in the interview was when Blunkett claimed that everybody recognised there was no question of anything negative about his use of words. The only people who'd kick up a fuss were people who "like to chat". I'm afraid I haven't checked the exact form of words yet, but the word "chat" was there. This is clearly another allusion to M. Thatcher who loved to go on about the "chattering classes", the idea being that these poncey, middle-class, guardian reading, radio 4 listening, folk should be ignored while we concentrate on the sensible folk who just get on with things without all this bloody talk. Ring any bells? Think of that guy across the channel who claims to represent "the real people" ...?</p>

<p>Last night on telly, Sandi Toksvig expressed surprise at recent news, saying "there seems to have been some terrible mistake, and the Labour government have appointed a Conservative as Home Secretary!" As Lloyd Grossman would say, "the clues are there"</p>

<h3 id="a004894">government and binding</h3>

<p>Academics spend a lot of energy trying to look hip and up to the minute with their students.</p>

<p>It used to be easy. Just mention Madge or Kylie or whoever and keep an eye on the latest trends. Before I had seen South Park, a linguist advised me to utter the phrase "you will respect my authoritah!" I couldn't bring myself to cheat like that, though.</p>

<p>The best exponent of the art I have seen is Deirdre Wilson, who has always been more up to the minute than her <span class="caps">UCL </span>students on the latest antics of the A list. In my day, I remember her referring to Sean Penn's photographer bating (OK, beating) and Ozzy Osbourne's dietary habits ("Ozzy's coming to dinner? I'll bring a bat!"). I wonder who features in her classes these days?</p>

<p>Recently, students have become more varied and it's that much harder to look like you're tuned in. I mean, naturally we've all forgotten John Major, but I've met students who don't remember, or haven't heard of, that horrible woman who dominated these parts in the 80s. You know, "the silent one"?</p>

<p>Anyway, it seems like I've just run into a bit of luck. I've been teaching a course on "Grammar, Standards and Correctness". The idea is not to correct the students, but to look at prescriptive attitudes to language and explore where notions of correctness come from. Imagine my delight when I found Brian Case's article "Gagging For It" in Time Out. He meets Mistress Chloe from "Fettered Pleasures" and discusses not only her range of merchandise (remote control triple ripple butt plugs, anal catheter with double balloons, you know, the usual stuff) but also some of the ways she deals with her clients. He points out that "she comes down like a ton of bricks on bad grammar" She says "I deserve proper grammar. I'm a stickler for that. I expect my submissives to observe proper grammar and if they don't, they have to write lines".</p>

<p>I wonder what I'd have to do to persuade her to come and give a guest lecture?</p>

<p>The rules for haikus in English are fairly strict, and a bit weird historically speaking. I mean, they were designed by speakers of Japanese, which is kind of, like, a whole nother language kind of thing. Anyway, here's one that's been breaking my heart recently:</p>

<h3 id="a004892">Monsters Inc.</h3>

<p>Just took the kids to see Monsters Inc, which was the best fun I've had for a while. I also enjoyed watching the kids working out how to get from the Barbican car park to the cinema (cinema 2, up on the 4th floor) and back, and how to deal with the eccentric arrangements for the sale of comestibles.</p>

<p>I hate to tell you how embarrassed I was this morning - two of the teachers at school organised a generation game assembly and I foolishly volunteered to take up the "chance of a lifetime" and be a humiliated parent. My task was to draw cartoon characters for my team to guess. Mickey Mouse, Dumbo and Marge Simpson have clear distinguishing features, but I'm afraid my attempt at Shrek was truly pathetic. I deserved to lose, especially as they even thought my Dumbo was Babar.</p>
