<h2>May 22, 2003</h2>

<h3>'it isn't easy having a good time...'</h3>

<p>Well, I thought three nights out in a row last weekend was impressive but after I go out for a drink with Eddie tonight, I'll have been out six nights out of seven. Monday was my night in but I went out for lunch with John that day as well. John says the main thing about my blog is that 'you never know what you're going to get' and he sometimes feels like he's tuning in to a soap opera having missed the last few episodes. So here's an omnibus edition just for him (and you): </p>

<p>Last Friday: <a href="http://www.tigerlillies.com">Tiger Lillies</a> in <a href="http://www.lyric.co.uk/lyric/whats_on/music/the_tiger_lillies.html">Gorey End</a>. Thirteen songs inspired by the work of Edward Gorey, based on unpublished work he sent to the Tiger Lillies before he died (too soon, unfortunately, to hear any of the songs). The evening was a kind of 'in memoriam' with Julian Bleach as compere and readings from Imogen Claire, Rosalind Knight, Alan Rickman and Josie Hall. It was a great evening and made me even more fed up that I never got it together to see their Shockheaded Peter last year. I've been enjoying my foyer-purchased CD all week (between nights out). </p>

<p>Saturday: a most elegant party at Rob and Jemima's swish, modern Highgate home (I know they were built 37 years ago as I met the neighbours who moved in when they were new). We started sipping champagne and apple martinis and nibbling sushi and ended up helping ourselves to more drink and fighting the rodeo bull they'd put in their central courtyard. This was karaoke-like in that the evening began with no-one wanting to go on and ended with everyone fighting for the next go. The operator was a bit of a sadist so Ohna made him get on so that she could dump him a couple of times. </p>

<p>Sunday: Neil Young solo and acoustic with no support at the Hammersmith Odeon (well, Apollo these days). They crammed loads of people in and we stood with two rows of people at the back of the circle, i.e. miles away. We passed binoculars around all evening and I tried not to Bogart them. It was a great show. Like the Tiger Lillies, he was presenting a new album. For the first hour and fifty minutes he talked us through a story about Earl and Edith Green, their daughter Sun, the Double E ranch and the community of Greendale. Quite Garrison Keillor-ish. Some great songs and moments, some slightly less gripping. And nice to get a whole narrative, together with some funny bits about how he writes and records ('I wake up in the morning, I think of three chords. I say 'that's it. those are the chords' and I don't change them. That's why all my songs are so simple'). Then he took a break and came back to perform a few oldies. The highlight for me was a speed-hymn version of 'After The Goldrush' with harmonica and organ (and of course Mother Nature was now on the run in the 'twenty-first century' rather than 'the nineteen-seventies'). </p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.neilyoung.com">Neil's Garage</a> for more on the Greendale album (not much yet, though).</p>

<p>On the way home, I was squeezed next to Rico on the tube. I didn't talk to him as two other guys got in first. So I just eavesdropped as he reminisced about his days with the Specials.</p>

<p>Tuesday: Apoa's (ex-)teacher's band's launch party for their new <span class="caps">CD.</span> They were very good, i.e. skilled, competent, etc. But sadly, it wasn't really my kind of thing (even though they jumped around different styles/genres). Read about the band <a href="http://www.meeker-seeker.com">here</a></p>

<p>Wednesday: watched Celtic lose with Alec and Kirsty. A great night despite them losing. Started off in Bradley's Spanish Bar, which is still a really special place. Tiny but everyone manages to get in. And a great atmosphere with 'Itchycoo Park' and 'White Horses' on the jukebox and a picture of Brigitte Bardot and Jane Birkin naked in bed together behind the bar. What more could you want? We then continued the Spanish theme by staying up too late in Bar Sol Ona, one of those late licence places that all Londoners need to know a few of.</p>

<p>Tonight: drinks with Eddie.</p>

<p>Anyway, that should keep John happy for a while. Me, I need some rest.</p>

<p>B-)</p>
