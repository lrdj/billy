<h2>May  9, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005413">I want to go to school</h3>

<p>I went with Dug and Tania to an event that was very much a <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org">Lecture List</a> kind of thing last night.</p>

<p>The <span class="caps">NFT </span>is showing a retrospective of films by <a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/showing/nft/archive/krish/index.html">John Krish</a>, who's a top British documentary maker. Among other things, he also worked on The Avengers, and he made an interesting contrast in his introduction between the tantrums and problems when he was on set with Steed et al and the sanity of working with schoolkids.</p>

<p>The films were great in themselves but it was also fascinating to look back in time. Most of the kids were just a little bit previous to my generation but I certainly remembered the various attitudes and looks and fashion statements. Also fascinating to see the institutions as they were then and compare with my own experiences as a kid then and as a parent now. One of them - 'I Want To Go To School' - was commissioned by the <span class="caps">NUT </span>and designed to let parents know what their kids got up to at school. One way things have changed is that most of us know exactly what our kids do at primary school these days and, at least at our place, we're welcome to go in and help as much as we want. (Not in France, though, as Tania pointed out).</p>

<p>There are a million things to say about how the films were put together, the documentary style and etc. and etc. But right now I've got some shopping to do.</p>

<p>You can read more about John Krish in <a href="http://society.guardian.co.uk/societyguardian/story/0,7843,950195,00.html">this piece</a> which was in the Guardian the other day.</p>

<h3 id="a005412">the lecture list</h3>

<p>I meant to tell you that Dug has created a blog for the Lecture List (or should that be The Lecture List?) It's <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org">here</a>. Do let us know any thoughts you have about it.</p>

<h3 id="a005411">jamie oliver meets fhm</h3>

<p>This is a message from Andy:</p>

<p>Hiya, I'm after a quick fav.</p>

<p>My mate has just started up a new website that needs a bit of advertising. Could you please forward on this address to as many people as you know, and ask them to look at it and pass the address on to as many people as they know etc.. </p>

<p>The site is still quite basic at the minute but will be updated and added to on a regular basis. The address is:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lovespuds.com">http://www.lovespuds.com</a></p>

<p>The creator says it's like Jamie Oliver meets <span class="caps">FHM.</span></p>
