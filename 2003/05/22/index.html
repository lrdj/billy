<h2>May 22, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005422">sad news</h3>

<p> Just got news that the <a href="http://www.eatmorewords.org">Eat More Words</a> project has been defeated: </p>

<p><q>Hello Eat More Words subscribers.</q> </p>

<p><q>Alas. After months of delays and elaborate plans and hopes for the future and dreams of words, words, and more words, we have some sad news. The powers that be in the land of the <span class="caps">OED</span> Online have decided that <span class="caps">EMW </span>does not qualify for access to their services. Despite our non-profit status through the Apicule Foundation. Despite the fact that other organizations provide online access to the <span class="caps">OED </span>to their members in very similar ways to what we proposed. We've tried to appeal the decision, but have had no luck, and unfortunately have to abandon the plans to provide <span class="caps">OED </span>access.</q> </p>

<p><q>So now we have some of your money and we need to figure out what to do with that. We'd like to offer you a few choices - please select one and let us know.</q> </p>

<p><q>1) Refund the full amount of my subscription/donation (in most cases, $10) </q> </p>

<p><q>2) Refund my subscription/donation minus the Paypal fees we incurred (in most cases, $9.41)</q> </p>

<p><q>3) Donate my subscription/donation funds to the National Center For Family Literacy (www.ncfl.org) or <span class="caps">PEN </span>(http://www.pen.org/)</q> </p>

<p><q>We're sorry this didn't work out as we'd hoped.</q> </p>

<p><q>There are other ways to access the <span class="caps">OED </span>online, if you're interested. In the <span class="caps">US, </span>you might see if your library offers online access. If it doesn't, you can join the Multnomah County library online (http://www.multcolib.org/card/cardnew.html) for $70, which gives you access to various other online databases as well (http://www.multcolib.org/ref/remote.html).</q> </p>

<p><q>We're really sad that we couldn't bring you the heaps of words we'd hoped to, and we hope that you will still be our friends and still send us interesting word-related things when you find them.</q> </p>

<p><q>Best,</q> </p>

<p><q>Caterina &amp; Judith</q> </p>

<p><q>ps. Want to use the <span class="caps">EMW </span>site for something spectacular? Let us know. The best idea (with a demonstrated commitment to actually get something going there, unlike what we did) can have the domain name.</q></p>

<h3 id="a005421">'sometimes when I smile my face aches'</h3>

<p>On top of all that I also had to turn down free tickets at the weekend to see Patti Smith performing at Charleston, Vanessa Bell's (well, it used to be hers) country house near Lewes. John says it was great but you can't do everything I suppose.</p>

<h3 id="a005420">'it isn't easy having a good time...'</h3>

<p>Well, I thought three nights out in a row last weekend was impressive but after I go out for a drink with Eddie tonight, I'll have been out six nights out of seven. Monday was my night in but I went out for lunch with John that day as well. John says the main thing about my blog is that 'you never know what you're going to get' and he sometimes feels like he's tuning in to a soap opera having missed the last few episodes. So here's an omnibus edition just for him (and you): </p>

<p>Last Friday: <a href="http://www.tigerlillies.com">Tiger Lillies</a> in <a href="http://www.lyric.co.uk/lyric/whats_on/music/the_tiger_lillies.html">Gorey End</a>. Thirteen songs inspired by the work of Edward Gorey, based on unpublished work he sent to the Tiger Lillies before he died (too soon, unfortunately, to hear any of the songs). The evening was a kind of 'in memoriam' with Julian Bleach as compere and readings from Imogen Claire, Rosalind Knight, Alan Rickman and Josie Hall. It was a great evening and made me even more fed up that I never got it together to see their Shockheaded Peter last year. I've been enjoying my foyer-purchased CD all week (between nights out). </p>

<p>Saturday: a most elegant party at Rob and Jemima's swish, modern Highgate home (I know they were built 37 years ago as I met the neighbours who moved in when they were new). We started sipping champagne and apple martinis and nibbling sushi and ended up helping ourselves to more drink and fighting the rodeo bull they'd put in their central courtyard. This was karaoke-like in that the evening began with no-one wanting to go on and ended with everyone fighting for the next go. The operator was a bit of a sadist so Ohna made him get on so that she could dump him a couple of times. </p>

<p>Sunday: Neil Young solo and acoustic with no support at the Hammersmith Odeon (well, Apollo these days). They crammed loads of people in and we stood with two rows of people at the back of the circle, i.e. miles away. We passed binoculars around all evening and I tried not to Bogart them. It was a great show. Like the Tiger Lillies, he was presenting a new album. For the first hour and fifty minutes he talked us through a story about Earl and Edith Green, their daughter Sun, the Double E ranch and the community of Greendale. Quite Garrison Keillor-ish. Some great songs and moments, some slightly less gripping. And nice to get a whole narrative, together with some funny bits about how he writes and records ('I wake up in the morning, I think of three chords. I say 'that's it. those are the chords' and I don't change them. That's why all my songs are so simple'). Then he took a break and came back to perform a few oldies. The highlight for me was a speed-hymn version of 'After The Goldrush' with harmonica and organ (and of course Mother Nature was now on the run in the 'twenty-first century' rather than 'the nineteen-seventies'). </p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.neilyoung.com">Neil's Garage</a> for more on the Greendale album (not much yet, though).</p>

<p>On the way home, I was squeezed next to Rico on the tube. I didn't talk to him as two other guys got in first. So I just eavesdropped as he reminisced about his days with the Specials.</p>

<p>Tuesday: Apoa's (ex-)teacher's band's launch party for their new <span class="caps">CD.</span> They were very good, i.e. skilled, competent, etc. But sadly, it wasn't really my kind of thing (even though they jumped around different styles/genres). Read about the band <a href="http://www.meeker-seeker.com">here</a></p>

<p>Wednesday: watched Celtic lose with Alec and Kirsty. A great night despite them losing. Started off in Bradley's Spanish Bar, which is still a really special place. Tiny but everyone manages to get in. And a great atmosphere with 'Itchycoo Park' and 'White Horses' on the jukebox and a picture of Brigitte Bardot and Jane Birkin naked in bed together behind the bar. What more could you want? We then continued the Spanish theme by staying up too late in Bar Sol Ona, one of those late licence places that all Londoners need to know a few of.</p>

<p>Tonight: drinks with Eddie.</p>

<p>Anyway, that should keep John happy for a while. Me, I need some rest.</p>

<p>B-)</p>
