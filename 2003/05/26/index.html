<h2>May 26, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005424">what the dudes 'n' chicks are up to</h3>

<p>Just enjoyed this insight into our younger citizens, from <a href="http://www.londonbylondon.co.uk">London by London</a>:</p>

<p><q><span class="caps">THIS ONE TIME,</span> AT <span class="caps">BAND CAMP</span></q></p>

<p><q>Dudes, I just wanted to know if anyone happened to be wandering around the Golders Green area last Saturday from around 9:00 to 12:00.</q></p>

<p><q>If you were then your probably still baffled about what you saw happen. If you were not there, I shall explain what did occur last Saturday night! Basically, all the dudes 'n'chicks in year 11 (15 to 16 year old) broke up from school last Friday, to go on 'study leave' for their <span class="caps">GCSE</span>s. I am one of these dudes and right at this moment I am meant to be 'revising'. To celebrate this two week holiday, *opps did i say holiday? I meant 'revision period' all the dudes from Westminster school decided to meet up at golders green station at 9:00. Yet one friend told another, and in the end chicks'n'dudes came from all over the capital including: <span class="caps">UCS,</span> City of London, Highgate, Westminister, Francis Holland, South Hampstead Girls school, St Micheals and word even got as far as my school (QE Boys) in High Barnet.</q></p>

<p><q>When I arrived at Golders Green station, it was absolutely buzzing, with 200+ peeps just chilling with each other. The chick to dude ratio was about 9:1, so i was definitely In there. After-a-while I went, with these two chicks ,from some french school, to buy some booze in the local 24/7. He denied to sell it to me, which really pissed me of, but God must have been watching, cause some guy gave us his un-opened bottle of Smirnoff vodka to share. And, oh boy, did we share it!</q></p>

<p><q>Around 10:00, someone must have called the cops, so this big group of 200+ went marching up towards Hampstead Heath. It was too dark in the heath, so we continued up to the high street, where we carried on the party.</q></p>

<p><q>In the end, one girl was knocked out somewhere on the street, and everyone else was either (1) harassing the rich snobs in Hampstead, (2) exchanging vodka from mouth to mouth or (3) in a fight. My good friend got attacked and beaten up. I found it funny at the time, and to be honest, still laugh about it now. About 12:00, it seemed to be getting a bit boring, so I headed back home on a night bus.</q></p>

<p><q>God I loving being me.</q></p>

<p><q>Oli, <span class="caps">NW8</span></q></p>

<p><q>[For the avoidance of doubt, this years 'dudes n chicks' quota has now been exceeded. Subscribers should avoid using either or these words in future correspondance. - ed]</q></p>
