<h3 id="a005587">another negative comment</h3>

<p>As with the last two, the effects were amazing with, inevitably, one or two disappointing moments (nothing as bad as the broomstick stuff at Hogwarts, though).</p>

<p>But if they've done such an amazingly good job of dealing with the relative sizes of the characters, why did the whole cinema erupt with laughter at the end when there were a couple of shots of hobbits next to Gandalf's knees?</p>

<h3 id="a005586">too much</h3>

<p>Yesterday morning Kiloh said 'this is the best birthday I've ever had' and also said that we'd given her too much so could we give her a bit less next year?</p>

<p>We went for pizza in the evening and she went in first and explained to the waiter that she had a reservation in the name of Kiloh. Then we went to see Lord of the Rings 3 at Muswell Hill Odeon where, sadly, the sound isn't great and we were miles from the screen. It was fun, but after 9 hours or whatever it was, I've now decided that this just isn't my kind of film. It's amazingly impressive film-making but I spent hours sitting watching yet another fight and not really knowing or caring much who exactly was fighting who or why, and wishing we could get back to a bit of interaction and maybe a joke or two. I also felt the jokes were sprinkled in rather than organic. I think I'd prefer something a bit more like <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0100142/">Metropolitan</a> where maybe the four hobbits sit around for an hour or two drinking from their flagons and chewing the fat.</p>

<p>We all showed remarkable endurance, finally leaving the cinema around 11.30 with only one or two naps being snatched during the film. Tonight we've got the real party to look forward to in the wonderful world of Quasar.</p>
