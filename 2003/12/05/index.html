<h3 id="a005577">about The Lecture List</h3>

<p>We've just tried to do something about the fact that visitors to the <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org">Lecture List</a> site have been left a bit confused about what the point of it is. Have a look and let us know what you think of it now. Has anybody got a nice picture of a lecture theatre or a seat in a lecture theatre or an ohp or anything?</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<h3 id="a005576">catching up</h3>

<p> I finally saw Tanja last night. We decided it was 14 years that we'd let go by since we last saw each other, so there was a lot of catching up to do. I think Tanja's developments were definitely more dramatic than mine but we've both had exactly two kids in the meantime. We had both been under the impression that Apoa was a bit older than Jan but in fact he's about two weeks older than her. She couldn't believe that I'd forgotten the night of the 6am dog attack. I do remember bits of it, but I enjoyed the bits she filled in for me.</p>

<h3 id="a005575">exam fever</h3>

<p> After their stage two exam Apoa and two of her pals bounced through the front door full of beans. The normally placid Apoa had her volume button up to 11 and they were all speaking simultaneously at great speed. (The other context where Apoa gets like this is during a card game.) The main thing that amused them about the exam was the formula question where everyone else had said the answer was:</p>

<p>3x + 1</p>

<p>but Apoa had put:</p>

<p>x + 2 + (x - 1 + x)</p>

<p>which, you'll realise, is a rather complicated way of saying 3x + 1. Hope the examiners realise that.</p>

<h3 id="a005574">pea fair</h3>

<p> Tuesday night was our Woodcraft pea fair, which means the kids worked in groups to prepare games or activities and then we dished out some peas to everyone and they went round paying with peas to take part in the activities.</p>

<p>I'm not completely sure what it is about trading or market forces that we're trying to show them but there were some interesting developments. The grownups didn't have enough peas and halfway through the evening half of the kids had run out. So the pea collecting stallholders swapped places with those who had spent their peas and we carried on like that for a while. The Bank of Pealand then announced a devaluation of the pea but still some kids were left pea-less so another announcement came which said that since 'this is woodcraft' some voluntary redistribution was in order.</p>

<p>The other main lesson was for the grownups. On a usual Woodcraft evening we struggle to keep 20 kids focussed but on Tuesday around 50 kids just got on with everything while the grownups stood around chatting.</p>

<p>My main contribution was to look after the hall users group's bric-a-brac stall. In little over an hour I took in around 12 quid for them.</p>
