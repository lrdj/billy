<h2>December  8, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005579">weekend</h3>

<p>The biggest events at the weekend were the christmas craft fair at school on Friday evening where I managed only to spend around 12 quid and then we went to a Children's Classic Concert at the Barbican on Saturday.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/W/wildestories/"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/giant.jpg" style="width:100px;height:100px;border:1px solid #999999;margin:2px 12px 1px 10px; padding:0px;" alt="the selfish giant" align="left" /></a></p>

<p>It seems that these are regular events where the audience has kids in it and they get to be noisy. At this concert, they screened two new animated versions of Oscar Wilde stories, 'The Nightingale and the Rose' (message: women are bad, well at least some women are) and 'The Selfish Giant' (message: don't be grumpy, let all the kids in the neighbourhood come and trash your garden as much as they like). We were told we could come dressed as princesses or as giants, and to bring flutes, recorders or percussion instruments. A lady in a wizard's cloak introduced it and told us when to make a noise. It was blooming noisy when everyone got going. And the older (13-14 year-old) kids joined in quite happily.</p>

<p>The films were good and the music that went with it was great as well, in a fairly traditional lyrical way. It was conducted by Debbie Wiseman who also composed it.</p>

<p>Sunday's highlight was a visit from Tim, Imogen and family who have moved to Bristol but luckily keep coming back because they haven't managed to sell their place here yet.</p>

<p>I capped the weekend by spending a couple of hours at Peter the school newsletter editor's house failing to upload pictures I'd taken at the fair onto his computer. Grrr!</p>

<h3 id="a005578">ice cream head</h3>

<p>Mr Frost came in the night so my head froze when I went downhill this morning. Now I'm worrying about what it's going to do to my skin. Is there a product that protects skin from cold weather (other than a balaclava, I mean).</p>
