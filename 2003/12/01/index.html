<h3 id="a005570">'Apoa? Is that a NAME?'</h3>

<p> That's what Ray Harryhausen said when I finally managed to get him to sign my book yesterday. We went back to the <span class="caps">NFT </span>for a workshop where we got to meet him, see a real model skeleton and dinosaur from his movies, hear how he made them move, and then the kids got to make their own skeletons from pipe cleaners and make a little animated movie of their own. It was great fun, especially for the older audience who seemed more impressed and excited to meet him than the kids were.</p>

<p>After he got over the shock of 'Apoa' I hit him with 'and Kiloh'. Just when he thought it was over, along came Oisin with his 'don't forget the foda' Irish name just to put the icing on the cake. I liked his reaction to Apoa's name. It reminded me of the times when people used to ask us the perfectly balanced question, 'Apoa, what kind of name is that?' Kiloh's womb-name was Spenglu which also got some interesting reactions.</p>

<h3 id="a005569">thanksgiving</h3>

<p>Had a nice thanksgiving dinner on Saturday, Thursdays being too complicated for people who work in a country where they don't celebrate it. Ohna made all the food, including pecan pie and brownies, and even made danish pastries which she baked on Sunday. I hope this is going to become a habit. We had a nice bunch of visitors, including Clemmie, who charmed everyone and then decided to spend the night. Apoa did a particularly good job of looking after her before she returned to her usual circumstances at the moment, with her dad following her round all the time reminding her to do her homework.</p>

<p>Robbie terrified me by revealing that he had discovered yet another embarrassing recording of me in my younger days, sitting around with Alec in an adjusted mental state listening to the Rocky Horror Show. He's now threatening to let me hear it one day. But he also emailed some nice pictures from Dug and Nicki's wedding. He's obviously been finding time to sort out his archives.</p>
