<h3 id="a005398">moral dilemma</h3>

<p> Got a stupid blooming parking ticket last week even though I don't even drive (obviously).</p>

<p>I did a quick double-park outside Birte's house while picking up Kiloh and Susie and found a ticket on my windscreen when I got out. Obviously, it was a speedy moded-riding traffic enforcer who got me. If I'd just left the front door open while I was collecting the kids I would have probably been <span class="caps">OK.</span> So now there's a 50 pound bill to add to the best part of 400 I'd just spent on getting the car fixed.</p>

<p>The thing is, I've just noticed that the speedy moped person was hurrying so much that s/he's got one letter of my registration number wrong...</p>

<p>Do you think it's worth the gamble of not paying and waiting to see whether they track me down? If I do, I guess the least I could do would be to broadcast the story on the internet to give them a sporting chance?</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<h3 id="a005397">an imitation of honesty</h3>

<p>Well, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007KN36/qid=10500535 83/">elephant</a> is as good as <a href="http://www.nme.com/reviews/11207.htm"> they say</a>, especially the one that sounds like they're hanging out on Lee Hazlewood's porch, but I've gone back to start listening to the first <a href="http://www.whitestripes.com/main.html">White Stripes</a> album, which is very led zeppy. You know, I just didn't like this kind of music back in the day. I did try my hardest for a while before the punk revolution decreed that I wasn't meant to like it anyway.</p>

<p>I like their concept of not using anything that was made later than 1963. Now there's something you can't do on the internet.</p>

<p>Why 1963, I wonder? Could it be anything to do with that poem by Philip Larkin about the invention of sex?</p>
