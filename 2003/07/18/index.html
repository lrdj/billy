<h3 id="a005468">crisp twaddle</h3>

<p>At last, some discussion of Alexander Walker that makes me feel like they're talking about the same guy. This is Xan Brooks in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/informer/story/0,1191,1001015,00.html" >The Informer</a> today after discussing The Hulk:</p>

<p><q>We will never know what Alexander Walker would have made of Hulk. After 50 years on the London Evening Standard, the critic died last weekend at the age of 73. Intriguingly, yesterday's Hot Tickets supplement still appeared in a state of denial about this, insisting instead that 'Alexander Walker is away' (in heaven, presumably). In the meantime there came a flood of tributes from rival critics and film makers, many of whom had previously regarded him with open exasperation.</q></p>

<p><q>I never knew Walker but I saw him many times. You couldn't miss the man. He would parade into morning press screenings in his spotless cravat, pass a few waspish comments with the regulars and then take his seat; a little duke presiding over a kingdom of pallid, coffee-drinking serfs. Much of what he wrote was reactionary twaddle, but every now and then he would startle you by championing a film you thought he'd hate, or destroying one you'd assumed he'd love. Walker's prose was crisp, sharp and passionate, and you had the sense that he believed every word he wrote (even when it was patently nonsense). Those morning screenings will be less interesting without him.</q> </p>

<h3 id="a005467">double bill</h3>

<p> First, I went with Apoa and Kiloh to see <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0315327">Bruce Almighty</a>, a classic 'self-centred whingeing twit gets comeuppance and learns to be nice again' movie. You can probably sketch out the story yourself but there were some good funny bits along the way. On the journey, Apoa and Kiloh learned a few more things about the etiquette of London bus travel (that's right - there isn't any). </p>

<p>Then I took them home and rushed off to Enfield to catch <a href="http://www.hooverstreetrevival.com/">Hoover Street Revival</a>, an excellent documentary, directed by Sophie Fiennes (who also directed my mum's wedding video). It's really impressive and she's a very talented director. It's literally a documentary, i.e. it documents Noel Jones's sermons, the people who attend them, and the context in which they take place, but it doesn't have a strong narrative shape and it doesn't really probe what's going on. Which has left some audiences unsure about it. There are stories there, though. It definitely made an interesting contrast with the 'high concept' first feature of the evening. </p>

<p>I wonder what film would be the right one to complete a trilogy of god-related movies?</p>

<h3 id="a005466">Bored Out Of The USA</h3>

<p>It seems it's such a bore getting an academic teaching visa now that Peter Trudgill won't be going to the <a href="http://www.lsadc.org"><span class="caps">LSA</span></a> Summer School (not to be confused with the <a href="http://www.lsa.org">Louisiana Sherrifs' Association</a>) this year.</p>

<p>Read about it <a href="http://linguistlist.org/issues/14/14- 1953.html">here</a></p>

<h3 id="a005465">Lavender Linguistics?</h3>

<p>The esperanto swearwords remind me a bit of Palare/Polari, which you can read about <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,997545,00.html">here</a></p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/letters/story/0,3604,998159,00.html">here</a> is a correction.</p>
