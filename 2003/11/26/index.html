<h3 id="a005561">debriefing</h3>

<p>Apoa enjoyed her day out test-taking. She got a bit confused with the multiple choice, put some answers in the wrong place and for various reasons there were a few that she didn't answer. But at least she's got it out of the way and can get back to being a normal kid for a while. Her next exam is next Wednesday.</p>

<h3 id="a005560">Closure of Linguistics at Durham</h3>

<p> This (from Dr. S. J. Hannahs to the <a href="http://linguistlist.org"><span class="caps">LINGUIST</span></a> list) is the latest news on the sad situation at Durham where the Linguistics department is being closed down, despite being one of the best departments around:</p>

<p><q>In response to the recent LinguistList postings concerning the Linguistics department at Durham (Issues 14.3155 and 14.3183), some clarification is in order.</q></p>

<p><q>As it currently stands, delicate negotiations are underway between the University of Durham and the University of Newcastle upon Tyne concerning the transfer of linguists from Durham to Newcastle. The full outcome of these negotiations is not yet known, and is partially dependent on funding from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). The current intention does not, sadly, involve the transfer of the whole department; however, we are confident that a fruitful venture can be established between linguists from Durham and the highly respected Linguistics Section at Newcastle.</q></p>

<p><q>We will let the community of linguists know how things progress!</q></p>

<h3 id="a005559">another test</h3>

<p> Apoa's off to another first round test today. She's gone to school with a packed lunch and a see-through plastic bag containing: a letter with her candidate number, several sharpened pencils (the one she'll actually use is 2 centimetres long), a rubber and a pound to buy a drink and a biscuit. Alice will be collecting her and a few other kids from school this morning and taking them to the test. She won't be allowed to park, just to drop off and collect later.</p>

<p>It feels weird not helping her get there and back, and we'll be going straight out after work tonight, so we won't see her until tomorrow. She's said she'll phone when she gets home, though.</p>

<p>Last night, Apoa prepared for the exam by going straight from school to practice in a local orchestra and then rushing home to gulp a couple of bites of food before going off to play guitar in a concert and then heading home for a late bath and a chapter of Peter Pan. Maybe not the best preparation but she seems cool about it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we're all dealing with the fact that some kids didn't get through the first stage at the other school, which is definitely not nice.</p>

<h3 id="a005558">rain</h3>

<p>I'm enjoying all the rain we're finally getting. It feels great once you've unpeeled all of your layers and made yourself a cuppa.</p>

<p>B-)</p>
