<h2>November  4, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005535">'he just drove away'</h3>

<p>I missed the beginning of the Flaming Lips because I was at the bar being held up by members of the support band Alfie (I think - they could have been just good lookalikes) so Robbie has described the beginning for me and also explained what happened on his journey home. When we heard that trains were disrupted and he had to get a replacement bus at Bognor we thought he might be in trouble (seeing as how the words 'bugger' and 'Bognor' have been known to go together in the past). Robbie's message:</p>

<p><q>Been to the lips <a href="http://www.flaminglips.com">website</a> to get more info and also to Alfie's <a href="http://www.alfie-uk.com">site</a> which is great. I listened to some of their tracks as well - I think they are even better recorded</q></p>

<p><q>The beginning is difficult to describe as it happened so fast - the music came on (forget what that piece is called) all the balloons billowed out with sparkly stuff - lots of coloured light on audience and on stage - and then they went into the song...</q></p>

<p><q>When I got to Bognor there were three of us waiting for the bus which did eventually come but refused to take us to Chichester as he was at the end of his shift. He just drove away...</q></p>

<p><q>The train people called us a taxi which they paid for - got home about 1.10pm</q></p>
