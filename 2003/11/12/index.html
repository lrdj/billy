<h3 id="a005538">schools</h3>

<p>Well, we have finally sent off all the forms for the various schools Apoa is applying for. Now we just need to torture her with homework and music practice until the end of January and then wait to see what happens. She's bearing up pretty well so far. She came back from a peace walk around Central London last night with a white poppy on her chest and another on her specs. I asked her about the walk and she told me about the difficulties of finding a chip shop that was open and how they settled for chocolate and crisps. When I asked her about the 'peace' part she explained that she, Jessie, Anna and Rachel were fairly peaceful at times.</p>

<p>I had to miss the walk because I was swimming with 18 elfins (6-9 year old woodcraft folk). Being male was definitely the short straw when we noticed the grownup to child ratios in the two changing rooms. The good bit, though, was having a session in the pool where there were professionals on hand to keep the kids safe and under control.</p>

<h3 id="a005537">what is a blogger?</h3>

<p>This was one of the questions in our pub quiz last night. It was approximately the only one we knew the answer to.</p>

<p>The quizmaster said about one question ('what are canopus and caloosahatchee?') that this referred to a news story we would all have heard about. But it turned out I hadn't even heard the story. It made me realise that I've been reading books lately and not reading newspapers. I think I'm just keeping up to speed with the top two or three stories every day. On the radio today, this story entered the top three and I heard about it for the first time. I'm not complaining, though. The books have been good.</p>

<p>The answer, btw, is that they're the proper names of the toxic ships George Bush is sending in advance of his own visit next week. And not, as we guessed, the proper names of Jake and Dinos Chapman's two plastic shagging people (well he did say it was topical and 'coming to a head' next week).</p>
