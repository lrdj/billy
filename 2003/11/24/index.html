<h2>November 24, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005557">another busy weekend</h3>

<p>This weekend included a visit from Rebecca and Derek who came for lunch with Thomas and Benjamin. It was fun watching them all playing together. They were very excitable in a way I associate with kids who don't see each other very often. We used to go mad whenever we saw our cousins. A big difference between Apoa and Kiloh and my childhood is that being on a farm in the countryside meant that we hardly ever saw any other kids so we always went a bit mad when we did.</p>

<p> We also went to a party where the dress code was '1963'. This was interpreted fairly loosely in general but one guest arrived in a full 1963 England football strip (although the shorts were suspiciously short, imho).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/nft"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/rayh.jpg" style="width:94px;height:94px;border:1px solid #999999;margin:2px 10px 1px 0px; padding:0px;" alt="Ray Harryhausen and friends" align="left" /></a></p>

<p>The highlight, though, was seeing Ray Harryhausen talking to Nick Park about animation. I mentioned this on <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org">Lecture List</a> as well, but I didn't tell them about my shame as I tried to jump the book-signing queue and was told to get lost. My excuse for this terribly un-British behaviour was that I'd been first in the queue, i.e. first out to buy a book from the stand, but then went back to find everybody else, not realising that this would mean losing my place. We didn't have time to wait around and I'm not really bothered about signatures anyway, so we gave up. I did manage to get Nick Park to sign it, though. Is that a major breach of etiquette?</p>

<p>I haven't had time yet to get the book out of Ohna's bag and see what it's like. I know the cover's good, though.</p>

<h3 id="a005556">test result</h3>

<p> We heard this morning that Apoa got through the first exam she's taken for the two selective schools she's going for. The second exam is next week. Meanwhile, her first exam for the other school is this Wednesday. It'll be good when this is all over, although she is coping with it all very well.</p>

<h3 id="a005555">never leave your bike at work</h3>

<p> I did on Friday which meant it took me two hours to get to work this morning (half an hour by bike). The bus was delayed because of a road closure caused by someone trying to jump from suicide bridge. It's funny how people in London are so used to this as well as to tubes being delayed by people falling or jumping under the trains. My brother saw someone jump under a train recently. It's always a gruesome thought but if it doesn't happen in front of your eyes, then people seem to be able to shrug and carry on trying to get to where they're going.</p>
