<h3 id="a005548">where do I live?</h3>

<p><a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/story/0,12956,1087545,00.html">This</a> is the kind of thing that makes me think I live in a weird little world that doesn't connect much with the rest of the country. It reminds me of the feeling I got when all those people queued up after the queen mother died. I still haven't met anyone who had any interest in that, and I still haven't met anyone who thinks the Iraq war was definitely a good idea.</p>

<h3 id="a005547">let it be - naked</h3>

<p>I was slightly sceptical, partly because I quite enjoyed the strings. But it is actually very good, and a definite improvement on the original, mainly because it feels like a coherent album now. Mind you, I don't think the relative incoherence made it untypical. All of their albums were a bit disjointed, weren't they?</p>

<h3 id="a005546">nice to see you</h3>

<p>Andy got us into the studio audience for Bruce Forsyth's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2003/10_october/30/forsyth_quiz.shtml">return to the <span class="caps">BBC</span></a> on Saturday night. It was fun to see some of the technicalities and very cool to see Brucie in action close up. What a professional. It took him about three seconds to find the best people in the audience to work with - three ladies called Rita, Iris and Doreen who fell about laughing after every rude remark he made. Some of his jokes and routines must have been travelling around with him for around 50 years. But they're still funny.</p>
