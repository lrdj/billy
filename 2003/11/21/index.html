<h2>November 21, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005554">a shitload more brevity</h3>

<p>I enjoyed this <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000132.html#more">follow-up</a> to Geoff Pullum's <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/000125.html">post about brevity</a> on <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/">language log</a> but I'm fighting hard not to get all pedantic about the bit of pragmatics in it.</p>

<p>By the way (he said, following the blogger's digression maxim), a linguist once joked to me that she was a pedant, pronouncing it 'peedant'. I still don't know whether the joke was that she was pedantically pronouncing it 'correctly' or pretending she didn't know how to pronounce it thus revealing that she was an amateur peedant. I wonder why I've never looked it up?</p>

<h3 id="a005552">we fought the law and the law lost</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1089158,00.html">This story</a> is number two in the <a href="http://blogdex.net">blogdex</a> chart of most contagious web pages at the moment, beating Michael Jackson into third place and beaten only by a joke from <a href="http://www.thetoque.net/">the toque</a></p>

<p>I must admit I'm not that shocked as I have always thought the American government was really only making a minimal effort to pretend the war was justified on moral grounds, let alone legal.</p>

<p>I'm more shocked by the extent to which the British public seems to be going along with the pro-war arguments at the moment. I was seriously depressed watching <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/question_time/ default.stm">Question Time</a> last night and had to turn it off in the end. The misrepresentation of anti-war views, the squashing of people trying to express them and the extreme rudeness to Vanessa Redgrave really got to me.</p>

<p>For the record, I'm pro-American, anti-Saddam, anti-terrorism and have no problem with Bush coming to visit. But I think it was wrong to go to war in the way they did. This combination of ideas doesn't seem to be permitted at the moment, except in those terrible North London circles I move in....</p>

<h3 id="a005551">On Planning</h3>

<p>Jed sent me this:</p>

<p><q>The Nobel Prize Winning economist, Kenneth J Arrow, was in the <span class="caps">USAAF </span>meteorological unit during World War ll. He quickly came to the conclusion that the medium-term weather forecasts which he was producing were no better than randomly right, and so asked to be relieved of this duty. <span class="caps">USAAF</span> Headquarters replied: 'The Commanding General is well aware that the forecasts are no good; however, they are needed for planning purposes...'</q></p>

<p>It seemed particularly appropriate when I was waiting for the bus with Apoa and everyone in the queue was laughing at the totally inaccurate and constantly updating <span class="caps">LED </span>display saying which bus was supposed to be coming when.</p>

<p>B-)</p>
