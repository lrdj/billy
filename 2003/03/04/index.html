<p> I'm so glad I still had the best part of a bike in a bin liner in the shed.</p>

<h3 id="a005349">sociable psychologists</h3>

<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/free/v49/i25/25b00701.htm">This</a> reminds me of two things linguists spend a lot of time complaining about: being asked how many languages they speak, and some of those funny myths about language like the one about eskimos having lots of words for snow or people in X remote community (it varies a bit, but the people of the Appalachians are a popular choice) who 'are still speaking Shakespeare's English'</p>

<h3 id="a005347">grrrr!</h3>

<p>Well, I've always been Mr. Super Safe when it comes to things like locking up my bike. But recently I decided to reinvent myself as Mr. Slightly More Casual. So I've just come out of the cafe and found my rear wheel missing.</p>

<h3 id="a005346">tenimeminem</h3>

<p>Apoa is ten today and I'm sorry to have to tell Fiona that I just gave her the 8 Mile soundtrack as a present. She's been into Eminem for a while but only found out at the weekend that I had all of his CDs guiltily hiding on a grownup shelf. Aidan was a bit surprised to find that I don't think Eminem is the devil. In fact, it seems like there's a bit of a movement to 'kiss his ass' among the middle class chatterers of North London.</p>

<p>Apoa and her mates don't only like him because of the 'plop-plop poo-poo' value of the swearing and she does say that there are some of the songs she doesn't like ('Kim', unsurprisingly, for example). She is currently setting her CD player to wake her with the 'public service announcement' announcing that the artiste does not make a defecatory donation what the listener might think if him, nay! he has said artiste's permission to fellate said artiste, and that the purchaser of this musical compact disc has, in the act of purchasing, performed an anal osculatory act in so doing (or words to that effect).</p>

<p>Diane (who has a 14 year old daughter) thinks it's important not to take too much of an interest in your kid's musical experiences when they're teenagers. So I'll have to train myself not to try to 'own' her music (or to giggle too much at the 'plop-plops')</p>
