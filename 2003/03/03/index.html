<h2>March  3, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005345">boycotts</h3>

<p> Here's what the <span class="caps">LSA </span>(Linguistic Society of America) just resolved:</p>

<p><q>At the 77th Annual Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America held 2-5 January 2003 in Atlanta, Georgia, the members attending the business meeting approved the following resolution opposing discrimination and political sanctions against scholars on the basis of their ethnicity, religion or country of origin. The resolution arose in response to sanctions in several European countries against scholarly collaboration with Israeli or Jewish linguists and other academics. These moves are intended to protest Israel's treatment of the Palestinians but target individuals irrespective of their personal stance on the issues involved. The text of the resolution follows:</q></p>

<p><q>Whereas there have been calls for and instances of boycotts of individual scholars (faculty, students and administration) and their universities, in response to the actions and policies of the governments of the countries or regions where these scholars work, or to the scholars' religion or ethnicity,</q> </p>

<p><q>Let it be resolved that</q></p>

<p><q>The Linguistic Society of America opposes all discrimination and political sanctions against scholars in any aspect of professional life (such as employment, publication, promotion, conference participation, educational exchanges, and research collaboration), where such discrimination is based not on the conduct of the scholars themselves, but solely on the scholars' religion or ethnicity, or on the actions or policies of the countries or regions in which these scholars live and work, or of which they are citizens. Such boycotts violate the principle of free scientific interaction and cooperation, and they constitute arbitrary and selective applications of collective punishment.</q> </p>

<p><q> This resolution will be sent to the full membership of the Society for their consideration.</q></p>

<p>I think they're right. I might think differently if it were part of a larger boycott that had had more discussion, especially with the people it's designed to help. But boycotting individuals in this context seems to me to do more harm than good.</p>
