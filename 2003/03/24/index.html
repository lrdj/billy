<h3 id="a005377">the German Rolling Stones?</h3>

<p>Actually, I guess I'd like to watch a documentary about the Baader-Meinhoff group. I wonder if I can get access to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/"><span class="caps">BBC</span> Four</a> by the time <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/baader-meinhof.shtml">this</a> is aired in April?</p>

<h3 id="a005376">another country</h3>

<p> <a href="http://www.baader-meinhof.com/"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/notbaader.gif" alt="nothing to do with me, mate" width="202" height="62" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>Saw another film last night that not many people will be getting to see. <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0309320">Baader</a> is a fictional movie about the Baader-Meinhof group of which only one print is in existence. <a href="http://www.vertigomagazine.co.uk/">Vertigo</a> brought that print to London for one screening last night. I don't know when or if it will be screened again.</p>

<p>There were a lot of good things about the film but it left me a bit unsatisfied. The director said it was deliberately fictional and not attempting to present 'the truth'. On the other hand, it was about real people and some of the scenes were based on what he had found out about them. What disappointed me, though, was that I wasn't really sure what the film was supposed to do to me beyond asking me to imagine a person who was like the fictional Baader.</p>

<p>Found a new late drinking venue after the screening. Do you think it will be sad when they finally scrap the licensing laws and there's nothing special about knowing where you can get a drink after midnight?</p>

<p>Came home and watched half the oscars, which was kind of an opposite extreme from a one-print no-budget arty movie. Steve Martin was funny and not afraid to be offensive. I'm glad some of the celebs didn't chicken out from saying something about Bush and Iraq and everything. I don't know how representative it is, but the main emotions the war is causing in people I've been coming across are sadness and depression.</p>

<h3 id="a005375">starting at the end</h3>

<p> After joining in on the beginning of the last one, we took the other option on Saturday and went straight to Hyde Park for the main part of the demo. I don't know how many hundred thousand were there (I think people think somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000) but it was pretty impressive. The last time, the kids seemed to be a bit unclear about numbers but on Saturday they were seriously impressed when they got on my shoulders and looked at all of the people. Sadly, the photos they took from there didn't come out.</p>

<p>This time we managed to do the whole thing without the kids declaring war on each other.</p>
