<p><a href="http://www.dear_raed.blogspot.com/">Salam Pax</a> is fed up with people wondering whether he's genuine or not. I believe him because why not, but you can see why people are suspicious. Here are some reasons:</p>

<p>- it's on the internet where 'you are who you pretend to be'</p>

<p>- he uses a nom de blog</p>

<p>- he doesn't tell us much about himself or other people he refers to</p>

<p>- he writes in English</p>

<p>- his language and style have lots of Western features</p>

<p>I wonder if we should get <a href="http://www.thetext.co.uk/faq.html">forensic linguists</a> on the case?</p>

<p>Has anyone been working on stylistic analyses of blogland?</p>

<p>btw, <a href="http://shakespeareauthorship.com/">Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare's plays</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521417376/">this</a> is the best evidence.</p>

<h3 id="a005379">nuns, whores and femmes fatales</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2003/03/20/actresses/">This</a> is an interesting article by Stephanie Zacharek at <a href="http://www.salon.com">Salon</a> about what counts as a good role for women. She writes:</p>

<p><q>I'll take a lace-and-leather sexpot over Nicole Kidman's prosthetic-honker performance in 'The Hours' any day of the week.</q></p>

<p>It hit a spot with me as I wasn't sure what Catherine Zeta-Jones's reference to <cite>'an amazing year for women'</cite> meant.</p>

<p>While I'm here, was anyone else irritiated by the way Ms Zeta-Jones lost her surname at the oscars? Sean Connery announced that <cite>'the oscar goes to ... [pause] ... Catherine'</cite> (possibly confusing Kathy Bates for a moment) and no-one mentioned her surname again. Was this a coronation ceremony or something?</p>

<p>I liked how <a href="http://film.guardian.co.uk/oscars/story/0,12712,920696,00.html">Xan Brooks</a> described <cite>'Zeejay'</cite>'s award:</p>

<p><q>6.40pm: Heavily pregnant and orange-skinned, Catherine Zeta-Jones steps up to collect the best supporting actress award for her turn in Chicago. Zeejay thanks husband Michael Douglas and confesses that she loves everyone (literally, everyone) in her native Swansea. In the audience, Douglas is most satisified. It looks like the cash he recently spent on that full-page advert in Variety, bigging up his wife's performance, was money well spent.</q></p>

<p>You'll notice <a href="http://www.salon.com">Salon</a> wants you to pay to read their stuff now, btw. You can always pay one day at a time by viewing a 15-second commercial with the option of muting the sound. I found that the sound of 21st-century commercialism blended rather well with Godspeed.</p>

<h3 id="a005378">'the skyline looks beautiful on fire'</h3>

<p> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000007T2Z/202- 2135545-5494228"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/godspeed.jpg" alt="F#A#Oo" width="130" height="130" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>Nothing gets you going in the morning like a bit of <a href="http://www.brainwashed.com/godspeed/main.html">Godspeed You Black Emperor</a>. Somehow 'The Dead Flag Blues' off of 'F#A#Oo' really hits the spot at the moment.</p>
