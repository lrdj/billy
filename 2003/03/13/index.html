<h3 id="a005360">get your war on</h3>

<p> <a href="http://www.mnftiu.cc/mnftiu.cc/war21.html"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/fries.gif" alt="freedom fucking fries" width="634" height="173" border="0" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.mnftiu.cc/mnftiu.cc/war21.html">Get Your War On</a> is out as a book (or maybe just as some pages stuck together, I'm not sure). There was a bit about it in the Guardian on Monday but it doesn't seem to be online. It's published by Soft Skull Press and you can buy it <a href="http://www.softskull.com/cgi- bin/SoftCart.100.exe/store/rees/gywo.html?E+scstore">here</a>. The UK distributor is at: 020 8829 3000 or: orders@turn-around.co.uk</p>

<h3 id="a005359">language testing</h3>

<p>I think I'm adding my name to the bottom of this letter which will be sent to the Guardian and to the immigration minister Beverley Hughes:</p>

<p><q>As teachers and researchers in linguistics, we wish to object strongly to the language tests for asylum seekers that have been introduced recently ("Language tests to uncover bogus Iraqi asylum seekers", Guardian 12 March).</q> <q>As the eminent linguist Lord Quirk said in the House of Lords in June last year, "placing people on the basis of their accent is more parlour game than forensic science". The government says that "language experts" will conduct the tests. We would like to know what kind of expertise will be called upon, and what qualifications, training and monitoring will be used to select these "experts". We are very doubtful that reliable expertise exists to enable people to identify where a speaker of a language comes from.</q> <q>We also deplore the government's emphasis on "bogus" asylum seekers at a time when an impending war looks likely to create a huge wave of refugees. We call on the government to treat all asylum seekers sympathetically and fairly.</q> <q>Yours sincerely,</q></p>

<p>The Guardian Report is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,912311,00.html">here</a> and you can find Randolph Quirk's remarks in the Lords <a href="http://www.parliament.the-stationery- office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds02/text/20610-01.htm#20610-01_star0">here</a></p>

<h3 id="a005358">really free music</h3>

<p>Jonathan wrote (a while ago actually):</p>

<p><q>Obviously it's hell living in Scotland, but one of the good things is Radio Scotland's eclectic music policy, and you can listen to it on the web</q></p>

<p><q>There's a good jazz/laid back beats programme called Be-Bop to Hip-Hop (nb the very nice Finnish jazzy/dancy track about 30mins in):</q></p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/radioscotland/programmes/other/bebop.shtml?focuswin">Be-Bop to Hip-Hop</a> </p>

<p><q>And last night I found myself listening to an hour of bagpipes, and liking it:</q></p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/radioscotland/programmes/other/pipeline.shtml?focuswin">pipeline</a> </p>

<p><q>Now I'm off to sit in a pub and complain about the English</q></p>

<p>I particularly enjoyed <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/radioscotland/programmes/other/pipeline.shtml?focuswin">pipeline</a>. <cite>'It ain't Beethoven but it sure bounces'</cite></p>

<h3 id="a005357">orwellian tyros</h3>

<p> Read <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/03/11/sprj.irq.fries/index.h tml">here</a> about the fantastic idea two republicans had of changing the names of <cite>'french fries'</cite> and <cite>'french toast'</cite> to <cite>'freedom fries'</cite> and <cite>'freedom toast'</cite> respectively, thus niftily linking the concepts <cite>'French'</cite> and <cite>'freedom'</cite> in the minds of people who hear about it.</p>

<h3 id="a005356">fight the non-violent fight</h3>

<p> The <a href="http://www.beastieboys.com/">Beastie Boys</a> are top of the pops on <a href="http://blogdex.media.mit.edu/">blogdex</a> at the moment.</p>

<p>Quite right too. They've put a new song up there for free download. It's called <cite>'In a world gone mad'</cite> and, as they say, it's <cite>'not an anti-American or pro-Saddam Hussein statement. This is a statement against an unjustified war'</cite></p>

<p>You can read the lyrics there, too. Here's an extract:</p>

<p><q>Mirrors, smokescreens and lies</q></p>

<p><q>It's not the politicians but their actions I despise</q></p>

<p><q>You and Saddam should kick it like back in the day</q></p>

<p><q>With the cocaine and Courvoisier</q></p>

<h3 id="a005355">war and language</h3>

<p>On the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/">Today</a> programme, I just heard John Humphreys (presenter) talking to Terry Jones (writer and ex-Python) and Ian Hargreaves (journalist) about language. Humphreys introduced the piece by saying that some have said that <cite>'if the first casualty of war is truth, the second is the English language'</cite></p>

<p>Humphreys didn't want to get political. Terry Jones, on the other hand, began by using the word <cite>war</cite> as an example. In his dictionary, war is a fight between armed people. In this case, the US has forced Iraq to disarm and is now going to bomb them. <cite>That's not a war; that's a turkey shoot'</cite>. Later, he discussed the use of the phrase <cite>'attack Saddam'</cite> to refer to <cite>'bombing hundreds of thousands of innocent people'</cite> while Saddam makes himself safe in a bunker somewhere.</p>

<p>Near the end, Humphreys said that while he believed the <span class="caps">BBC </span>was non-partisan (polite coughs - or were they giggles? - from the others), they did tend to use the phrase <cite>'collateral damage'</cite> rather than <cite>'children being blown to bits'</cite>. Hargreaves responded by saying he hoped people would switch off immediately if they did ever do things like that.</p>

<p>You can hear the clip from <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/listen/listen.shtml">here</a> if you've got the patience to work out how to get to clip 6 and then move forward to the last fifth (roughly) of it.</p>
