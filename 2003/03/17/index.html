<h3 id="a005365">normal wacky or wacky wacky?</h3>

<p>Some people thought the Guardian's cricket journalist had seriously lost the plot, btw. In fact, this is just the kind of thing those crazy Guardian people do. The Guardian's own <a href="http://www.onlineblog.com">online blog</a> had <a href="http://www.onlineblog.com/archives/2003_03_09_onlineblog_archive.html#90700440">a post</a> about it on the day.</p>

<h3 id="a005363">Jonathan Richman and candles and stuff</h3>

<p>Apoa took these photos at our most local candlelit vigil last night.</p>

<p>Shepherd's Bush scared me (it often does, actually). Gangs of cyclists without lights were charging around all over the place, scaring pedestrians on narrow pavements and arguing with each other. I noticed quite a few bits of bikes chained to railings. I was relieved to find all of my bits still there at the end of the night.</p>

<p>Jonathan Richman gave a most impressive multilingual performance, although to be honest I don't know how accurately he was speaking all of the languages he used. The Hebrew bit might well have been just nonsense syllables with a few velar fricatives (correct me if that's not the right term) thrown in here and there. Still, he was great. He made it feel like he was performing in a little room rather than in front of 1,000 people (I'm guessing). My favourite bits were when he would step away from the mike to say something. First, you were surprised that you could hear him and then you realised that that meant everyone in the place was listening in silence. He was accompanied just by Tommy Larkins on drums, who was also most impressive, btw.</p>

<p>Near the end, he said he'd give us just one verse about the war. The words were:</p>

<p><q>Not in my name in Baghdad</q> <q>Not in my name any more</q> <q>Cos the children</q> <q>We'll be killin</q> <q>Did not put anyone in power</q></p>

<p>Then he went straight into another of his <cite>'wild and crazy'</cite> songs about his night in the lesbian bar with Pablo Picasso warning his ex-girlfriend about the possible drug issues surrounding her new boyfriend, or something like that. He didn't do anything like Road Runner, Ice-Cream Man, That Summer Feeling, etc. etc. But he did do Stop Your Sobbing as a tribute to Ray Davies (since he was in his home town).</p>

<p>On the way home I passed the site of our vigil. It was around midnight and two candles were still burning. Pretty amazing, especially around here.</p>

<p>If you'd like to visit a website about Jonathan Richman, check out <a href="http://www.base.com/jonathan/jonathan.html">this site</a>, aka <cite>'The Abominable Lesbian Vampire Cappuccino Bar in Cyberspace'</cite></p>
