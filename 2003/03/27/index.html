<h3 id="a005384">raf and sheta shonesh</h3>

<p>Hanna (who's German) writes:</p>

<p><q> these <span class="caps">RAF </span>"wanted posters" they put up in '71. They must have been around a very long time, I remember seeing them everywhere, and I was born in '72. Maybe I've seen them on telly in German crime series or something, but one way or another they have been around extremely long! And I wonder if this is me being extremely pedantic now, because I really would like to know whether someone left out a word by mistake in the Ben Lewis interview (BBC4), or whether he got it all wrong: <cite>'I think young Germans were very guilty about the past...'</cite> I think that's part of the problem many Germans have with their German identity, that they often cannot differentiate between 'being guilty' and 'feeling guilty'. I don't know, but I do think about this sometimes. Did you see that banner on the demo on Saturday, <cite>'For the first time I am proud to be German'</cite>? I quite liked that.</q></p>

<p><q>And then Sean Connery handing over the Oscar. I watched the 'highlights' on Monday, presented by Jonathan Ross, and I clearly remember Connery saying 'Kasherine Sheta Shonesh' (sorry, I'm not pasting in any special (phonetic or other) symbols anymore on this email software since I kind of joked around with funny Greek, Arabic and whatever the other stuff was, letters in an email, and the software sent three digit numbers instead), and then Ross made a funny(not) comment on it, something like 'how he said her surname, that must have been tough for him' (of course it was slightly more 'subtle' than that). So am I just imagining remembering Connery saying the surname? Or did they put it in afterwards? Very strange.</q></p>

<p>My guess on the guilt is that he did mean 'felt guilty' rather than 'were guilty'. On Sean Connery, I do know the answer, though. He said her name when reading out the nominations but not when announcing the winner. You can double-check <a href="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-video/Film/video/2003/03/24/catherine1.mov">here</a> </p>

<h3 id="a005381">culture</h3>

<p>Crammed a lot in yesterday. Started with breakfast and a meeting with James and Dug, then a riverside cycle for a quick burst of <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/beckmann/">Max Beckmann</a>, and <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/kapoor/">Anish Kapoor</a>, at the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/default.htm">Tate Modern</a>, a bit of work at the library and a late afternoon seminar (on one way in which <a href="http://www.isc.cnrs.fr/nov/novmenu.htm">children are more logical than adults</a>) followed by a trip to the South Bank to meet Ohna for a bite to eat and the <a href="http://www.gpdances.com/"> George Piper Dances</a> at the Queen Elizabeth Hall.</p>

<p>I didn't really know Beckmann's work which is lively, theatrical and comic (in style even though not always funny). Time Out says the self-portraits are best, and I agree, but I also liked the bronze sculptures.</p>

<p>Anish Kapoor's <cite>'big plasticky thingy'</cite> is really impressive, taking over the big turbine hall and making you feel like climbing in.</p>

<p>The seminar was fascinating. It seems that kids are less likely than grownups to think that <cite>'some cows are mammals'</cite> is false. Or, to put it the other way round, grownups are more likely than kids to make the jump to thinking <cite>'some X are Y'</cite> must mean <cite>'some X are not Y'</cite>. Confused? You will be.</p>

<p>I love the South Bank. The architecture makes you feel like you've time-warped back to a glorious age where there are always lots of people enjoying cultural activity. The people are a good mix of young and old, smart and casual, X and Y. Of course, there's some pattern here - the older ones tend to be smarter. And why are there always busloads of older folk dressed very smartly in ballgowns and evening dress? We weren't convinced that the buses had started their journey in our world. And you never know when a poet laureate will just appear and start signing books next to you.</p>

<p>The dances were great, btw. The first half of the evening was made up of five new pieces by top choreographers accompanied by short films about how they work. At the end of the evening they showed some out-takes and other funny bits. Soon, all dance events will have to have one.</p>
