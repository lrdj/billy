<h3 id="a005454">one down, two to go...</h3>

<p>Well, Ginger Nut has left home now, which is sad but also a bit of a relief. Four kittens is just too many by the time they're eight weeks old and not properly litter-trained. Sparks went to Lily's on Saturday but came straight home because the cat they already have couldn't cope. We're hoping that a neighbour will be taking Sparks and Pusscat soon. Things will be much easier once we know who to blame for the accidents.</p>

<h3 id="a005453">Do they want to force me to get a driving licence or what?</h3>

<p>Hanna sent me a link to <a href="http://pbisotopes.ess.sunysb.edu/bicycle- muenster/index.html#transportation">this site</a> about Germany's bicycle capital, Muenster.</p>

<p>I advised her to look in Hill's in Muswell Hill for a second-hand bike. They didn't have one, so she said to Mr. Hill that she might be better buying one in Germany. he replied:</p>

<p><q>'Oh yes, they are much better there, everything is better in Germany, they should have won the war, then we would have all the good stuff here!'</q></p>

<h3 id="a005452">'I need no introduction'</h3>

<p>From the point of view of the <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org">Lecture List</a>, there was an interesting <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,986193,00.html">article</a> by the pianist Susan Tomes in Saturday's Guardian. </p>

<p>She talks about the pros and cons of musicians and conductors discussing a piece before performing it. The main con is that it's difficult for the performers. The main pro is that audiences like it and seem to enjoy the performance more for having had an introduction. She says: </p>

<p><q>Sometimes it was almost galling to be told what a difference one's spoken words had made. Clearly, it did cause the audience to see us as real people rather than... well, I still don't know what the alternative is: frightfully posh people who inhabit a different world altogether?</q> </p>

<p>The main thing I take from it is that audiences are really keen to have an encounter with the performers that's more direct than just watching them perform. Which is kind of what the whole Lecture List thing is about. </p>

<h3 id="a005451">more music</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/fish.jpg" /></p>

<p>Had another busy weekend starting with the school summer fair on Saturday, preceded as is now traditional (well, they did it last year) with the procession of the fish. The route was a bit longer this year, so I'm still hopeful that this could be the start of something big.</p>

<p>Yesterday we went to Kenwood to see the Haringey Picnic Concert with a huge number of music groups, including Apoa's guitar group, playing and dancing in a huge number of different styles. It wasn't Glastonbury but it was good fun. And a lot easier to recover from.</p>

<p>Kiloh can't decide whether she's more into Diana Ross or Avril Lavigne.</p>
