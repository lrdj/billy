<h3 id="a005436">you'll never guess what that war was all about</h3>

<p>What can you say about <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,970331,00.html">this </a>? I suppose it's good that someone is just admitting what's really going on for once.</p>

<h3 id="a005435">Scottish Exclusive (again)</h3>

<p>Bessie and Ted are in the media spotlight again. Read all about it <a href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/features/featuresfeed/page.cfm?obje ctid=13021983&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=89488">here</a></p>

<p>I guess this is what it must be like to have Posh and Becks as parents. Maybe I should offer Brooklyn and Romeo some tips?</p>

<h3 id="a005434">leave the dude alone</h3>

<p> Remember <a href="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/billy/permalinker/?pid=816&amp;blog=bi lly">Oli</a> and his tale of what the <cite>'dudes 'n' chicks</cite> are up to? The poor boy is seriously and serially savaged in this week's <a href="http://www.londonbylondon.co.uk/">london by london</a>, including various Nazi comparisons. But one voice came to his defence:</p>

<p><q>Just before the inevitable festival of abuse starts about Oli's comments last issue, I'd just like to point out that I remember when I was that irritating and, given the fullness of time, I turned out to be alright. If you think hard enough, you'll remember that you were that irritating when you were 16 too. Any suspicions you have that you weren't that irritating are entirely false and should therefore be disregarded. You were. Leave the poor boy alone. Anyway. As you were.</q></p>

<h3 id="a005433">fight the evils of the night bus.</h3>

<p> Just got a message from <a href="http://www.londonbylondon.co.uk/">London by London</a> which said, among other things, that:</p>

<p><q>London is an amazing city. A city of culture, history and diversity. A city with a mayor who collects newts. A city with a huge Ferris wheel. A city where the clubs and bars stay open 'til three at the weekend... But a city that's an absolute nightmare to get home from after midnight.</q></p>

<p><q>We're creating a petition to be sent to both The Mayor and Transport For London - the two bodies who together control London Underground - demanding that the Tube be kept running until at least 3am on Friday and Saturday nights.</q></p>

<p>The petition is <a href="http://www.londonbylondon.co.uk/latetube">here</a></p>
