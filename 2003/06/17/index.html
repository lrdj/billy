<h2>June 17, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005448">George Orwell</h3>

<p>I'm enjoying all the Orwell stuff on the <span class="caps">BBC </span>just now. <cite>George Orwell: My Life In Pictures</cite> was really enjoyable, although the choices they'd made about how to tell the story were really up front, and there was something a bit simplistic about the main component of the narrative, which was <cite>'bullied for bedwetting at 8 years old leads to lifelong commitment to fighting totalitarianism'</cite> (or is it my interpretation that's simplistic?) </p>

<p>It seems particularly relevant today when parliament is trying to work out the size of the lies that led to the war in Iraq. I'm still not totally sure what I think about the Iraq thing but I know the way our government got us there was wrong. </p>

<p>I'm also enjoying the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/book_of_the_week.shtml">essays</a> being read every day on radio 4.</p>

<p>Today's started with <cite>'Confessions of a book reviewer'</cite> which is very funny and also relevant since I've just been reading Jonathan's review of two books that some editor thought would <cite>'go well together'</cite></p>

<p>That was followed by a discussion of borrowings in English, which was amusing and opinionated. He mentioned a few borrowings from German which followed the war. <cite>'Schadenfreude'</cite> wasn't one of them, though.</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<h3 id="a005447">the cats are real</h3>

<p>They're not some ironic postmodern comment on blogging or anything. We've got them all back from Devon now. I joined in for the last few days and enjoyed a combination of swimming, football, park-visiting and lying around in the sun.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I took Jazzy to the vet to be spayed. The vet advised keeping her away from the kittens overnight to protect the stitch, and keeping her inside for ten days until the stitch comes out. We felt really guilty locking her up in the bathroom overnight. But when we got up in the morning she was outside. She'd jumped to the very top of a sash window and squeezed through a tiny gap.</p>

<p>Anyway, she seems to be recovering well. Hope the hair grows back quickly. Without it, you can see just how skinny breastfeeding has made her.</p>
