<h3 id="a005445">dinner party inspectors</h3>

<p> <a href="http://www.channel4.com/life/microsites/D/dinner_party_inspector s/index.html">This</a>, on the other hand, is exactly my kind of programme. I think my favourite piece of advice was <cite>'when even the non-smoking guests are sneaking out to join the smokers on the terrace, it's time to change the subject'</cite></p>

<h3 id="a005444">schadenfreude</h3>

<p>Phew, <a href="http://pub129.ezboard.com/fgarbledcommunicationsdiscussionforumf rm2.showMessage?topicID=60.topic">this</a> makes me glad I didn't sit through <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/tv/dale.shtml"> Dale's Wedding</a></p>

<p>It really was an incomprehensible show. The premise wasn't funny, none of the individual bits were funny and no-one made much effort to disguise the fact that they were pretending. Why did they do it?</p>

<h3 id="a005443">Dale comes in</h3>

<p>Did anybody watch that programme about Dale Winton's Wedding last night? It was weird. It was purporting to be a documentary about Dale getting married and thus shocking the nation by turning out not to be gay after all. It seemed to be a joke as everything in it was acted and there were weird stories about women throwing themselves on him and him switching from Mr. Ladykiller to Mr. Camp when he was on air. The one thing that made us think it might not be a joke was that it wasn't funny. Intrigued though we were, we got too bored after twenty minutes to watch it to the end. Somehow, the central question wasn't quite as pressing as all the stuff about interest rates and currency management on the other channels. Can anyone fill us in?</p>

<h3 id="a005442">The Men From The Agency</h3>

<p>Simon told me about <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo/listings/programme.shtml?day=today&amp;service_id=4224&amp;filename=20030610/20030610_2320_4224_40035_70">this</a> interesting programme on <span class="caps">BBC4 </span>about Saatchi, Parker, Puttnam et al and their advertising work in the 60's. It's on tonight as part of the <cite>'BBC4 on 2'</cite> thing.</p>

<h3 id="a005441">baps fae Buckie</h3>

<p> Had a nice lunch with Jonathan, Jennifer and Lawrence yesterday. I was surprised to discover that Jennifer hadn't heard the expression <cite>'gi wa ti Buckie n buy baps'</cite>. Always glad to pass on new data to a linguist (Jennifer is an expert on the Buckie dialect and is currently having some of her work <cite>'squeezed into a minimalist framework'</cite>)</p>
