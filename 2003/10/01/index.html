<h3 id="a005510">Blair and Brown</h3>

<p>I enjoyed <a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/D/the_deal/index.html">The Deal</a>. I think my favourite bit was when Blair told Brown to say hello to Patsy Palmer (well, I think that's who they meant) on his way out of Granita and when they showed us the real Blair and Brown together right at the end.</p>

<p>I do think Blair's performance yesterday was brilliant as a performance and I do think there was some substance there, but not about actual policies or decisions or anything. What gets my goat, though, is when you hear him talking about the Iraq thing and constantly focusing on whether it would have been OK if they had done nothing at all about Iraq (he says 'we', of course but that word sticks in my throat). Surely everyone can see that there were more than two options available? There are surely a lot of people who think something should have been done but not the things that they have done. Nearly all of the members of the <span class="caps">UN, </span>for example?</p>

<p>The thing I always remember is that Blair stated quite clearly that he wouldn't support Bush if there wasn't a new UN resolution and then changed his mind when it became clear there wouldn't be one. And nearly everybody must see that there was a huge amount of deceit and dishonesty when he was trying to persuade people to support the war. I think he might survive, though. I'm not sure that people care too much about honesty when it comes to politics. I bet Dirty Den would have a fair chance of getting elected if he stood. (Arnie and Dirty Den - now that would be a special relationship.)</p>

<p>Apparently, when some Hollywood producer was told that Reagan was standing for president, he replied:</p>

<p><q>No, no. Jimmy Stewart for president. Reagan for the best friend.</q></p>

<p>B-)</p>

<h3 id="a005509">on the road again</h3>

<p>Well, I had to take the bus again to go and collect my bike and it was even worse. 40 minutes to get from one end of Upper Street to the other. How many million people are being made miserable like this everyday? I'm glad I've got my bike back.</p>
