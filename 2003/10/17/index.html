<h3 id="a005522">FBI Internships</h3>

<p>I enjoyed receiving an email just now from James R. Fitzgerald, Supervisory Special Agent, Federal Bureau of Investigation. to let me know that the <span class="caps">FBI </span>internship programme has now been expanded to include linguistics graduates as potential interns. The message was sent to the Forensic Linguistics mailing list and forwarded on to a different list which I'm on. The first sentence of the email was 'Some of the List members are familiar with me'. I enjoyed both the ambiguity and the echoes of Blur's 'We've Got A File On You' which I'd just been listening to and which had been reminding me of Gilbert and Sullivan's song in the Mikado, 'I've Got A Little List', as well as that joke about ex-Stasi employees getting jobs as taxi-drivers after the Berlin Wall came down (the one about them being great taxi drivers because they 'know where you live')</p>

<h3 id="a005520">language judgement</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.linguistlist.org"><span class="caps">LINGUIST</span></a> readers were shocked the other day to hear about a judge in Nebraska who had apparently told a father not to 'speak Hispanic' to his daughter or risk losing his visitation rights. Apparently, he had said 'it's hard enough to learn English, you know'.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's what happened when another linguist phoned the judge to protest:</p>

<p><q>I was so alarmed after reading the article mentioned yesterday on linguist list (Linguist 14.2777) that I googled the judge's name to get his address/phone number and then I called and left a long message saying that the ruling was harmful and ill-informed and went on to say why this was so, and who I was etc.</q></p>

<p><q>To my surprise, I got a call from Judge Reagan's secretary this morning, responding to my message of last night. She said she has been getting a lot of responses like mine and she wanted me to know that both sides are not coming out in the press and that in the courtroom the judge had said that he is for bilingualism and wishes he were bilingual himself. She said that the issue is that the father was in jail for the first 5 years of his daughter's life and the girl doesn't know him and he wants to speak only Spanish with her and she doesn't understand any Spanish. I told her that linguistically there is nothing wrong with being immersed in a language at age 5 and in fact that would be a better way for her to become bilingual than the 'this is a carro, that is a mochila' method, but that it sounds like the real issue is that she didn't know her father until now and that her current discomfort with her father seems magnified (to her, her mother, the judge) with the additional linguistic difference. So, I still don't think that was the right ruling, and I don't know about the whole 'speaking Hispanic' thing, but I sure was impressed that someone actually called me back. </q></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.omaha.com">Omaha World Herald</a> is now running an online vote asking whether the judge was right. You can find a link to the story near the voting buttons at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>The guy on the bike wasn't injured at all, by the way. It looked like his brakes weren't working but he managed to slow down enough to get onto the pavement, despite the fact that another cyclist who'd just taken refuge there was in his way.</p>

<h3 id="a005518">saved</h3>

<p> Being a <a href="http://www.hayward.org.uk">Hayward</a> Explorer got me an invite to a breakfast reception plus a tour of <a href="http://www.hayward.org.uk/saved!/">Saved</a> this morning, which was coolissimo. A cup of calm, a mini-muffin, a danish, a short guided tour, a free audioguide, a rokeby venus poster, and getting to see the exhibition before anyone else with only around 40 people in the gallery. Highlights included a letter Mary Queen of Scots wrote the night before she was executed, the burghers of calais on the terrace, some golden treasure from a spanish armada boat, the only spherical astrolabe still in existence, and loads of things.</p>

<p>On the way there, I saw a man nearly die by driving into the side of a lorry who was turning left (the most common cause of death for cyclists in London) just before reading a stencil telling me I was travelling over the spot where a bicycle messenger was recently killed and then being terrified by a car who was passing me as I was about to pass a stationary bus. On the way back another driver shouted at me as he passed me, I think because I wasn't close enough to the kerb for his liking. It's still better than the tube, though.</p>

<h3 id="a005517">spirited away</h3>

<p>Thanks to <span class="caps">UNISON </span>being on strike in Haringey yesterday, I finally managed to take the kids to see <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0245429/">Spirited Away</a>.</p>

<p>It really is a fantastic movie. When it ends and you come back to the beginning, it seems like the beginning was a long time ago and that an awful lot has happened since then.</p>

<p>I didn't think the kids would enjoy subtitles so we went to the Coronet in Notting Hill, which was nicely nostalgic (even though it's changed a bit since our day, including no longer allowing people to smoke) only to discover that Time Out had made a mistake and it was subtitled after all. I'm glad because I now know that subtitles are no problem for them and also because the word is that the dubbed version is a bit dodgy, for example translating what should be 'sorceress' as 'witch' and what should be 'gods' as 'spirits'. I have no way of knowing whether that's right but I prefer the subtitled words anyway.</p>

<p>It was also interesting introducing the kids to the concept 'rush hour' when we took the tube home.</p>
