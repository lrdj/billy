<h3 id="a005527">IDS</h3>

<p>Does anyone else think it's a bad sign that he himself wants to be known as 'IDS'?</p>

<p>And is there a difference between a vote of confidence and a vote of no confidence?</p>

<p>B-}</p>

<h3 id="a005526">exam</h3>

<p>Apoa's chance to use my ipod came on the way home from her first selective school exam. This is a school where 1800 kids apply every year and 180 get in. There was a lot of nervousness around, most of it being felt by grownups. Most of the grownups I overheard were talking about how cool their kids had been about it all. One of them said:</p>

<p><q>I couldn't sleep last night, but she's been completely fine</q></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099446987/"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/sidetracked.jpg" alt="Sidetracked" border="0" style"display:block;width:86px;height:140px;margin-right:10px;" align="right" /></a>Apoa too was very cool about it. We had to wait around in a crowded hall for half an hour before the exam. She just sat there calmly making a friendship bracelet while I read a bit more of my current book, which is <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099446987/">Sidetracked</a> by Henning Mankell. It's a really good crime novel, although there were a few moments in it where I've been wondering a bit about the translation (you know that feeling where you don't know whether the original author or the translator decided to put it like that).</p>

<p>Apoa did show one sign of nervousness, though. She went to the loo just before she went in and then thought she needed to go again straight away. By the time she came out of the exam, she didn't need to go any more.</p>

<p>The pencil she used for the exam was 3 centimetres long. I did persuade her to bring in one full-length spare but she insists that these little stubs are easier to use.</p>

<h3 id="a005525">where the kids are at</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.pinkfloyd.co.uk"><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/floyd.jpg" alt="the lunatic is on the grass" border="0" style"display:block;width:50px;height:46px;margin-right:10px;" align="left" /></a>Thanks to Ohna, I've now got one of <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">these</a> and am enjoying it very much. The kids are enjoying borrowing it and I enjoy checking out their listening preferences. On Sunday, Kiloh went straight for the <a href="http://www.superfurry.com/">Super Furry Animals</a> (Rings Around The World) and yesterday Apoa went first for Brain Damage by <a href="http://www.pinkfloyd.co.uk">Pink Floyd</a> before moving on to the <a href="http://www.whitestripes.com">White Stripes</a>. The White Stripes are really big in the primary schools of North London and Seven Nation Army will be featuring in Apoa and Kiloh's next school orchestra performance.</p>
