<h3 id="a005513">above the below</h3>

<p>Went to see <a href="http://www.davidblaine.com">David Blaine</a> with Kim while she was here. She said she had promised Jonathan she'd have a look. I don't think it's as stupid as most people do. I mean, everyone's talking about him, aren't they? I'm sure that's his main aim. And it was slightly interesting to stand there looking up from beneath the above the below.</p>

<h3 id="a005512">tea leaves</h3>

<p>Well, I really could have done without having to spend two hours (and a load of dosh) replacing my bike saddle today after some tea leaves half inched it. Funnily enough, this happened outside the Barbican where I met someone last week who'd just had his bike nicked. I guess everywhere is equally dodgy in London but maybe that bit of pavement is made more dodgy because there aren't many pedestrians there.</p>

<p>Enjoyed Mike's show on Wednesday and had a nice time with Kim and Mike and Gerry then and yesterday, exploring family and other pasts and presents. Being a kid in Kintore feels like a really long time ago now. Meanwhile Bessie and Ted are in Blackpool having a romantic holiday to celebrate the anniversary of their first wedding, which was 60 years ago next week. I can't imagine what it feels like to look back that far over all the things that have happened in between.</p>
