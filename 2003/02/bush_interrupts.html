<h2>February 10, 2003</h2>

<h3>Bush interrupts Oprah</h3>

<p> This came from <a href="http://www.academicsforjustice.org/">Academics for Justice</a>. It's good to hear that on US TV <cite>'the British correspondent said at one point that it was hard to find anyone in Britain <span class="caps">EXCEPT TONY BLAIR </span>that supported the war'</cite> (even though I can think of one or two others)</p>

<p><q>Understanding What Just Happened on The Oprah Winfrey Show </q></p>

<p><q>Today, Oprah Winfrey started a two-part series focusing on the impending <span class="caps">U.S. </span>war on Iraq. About halfway through the show the broadcast was pre-empted by coverage of Pres. George Bush, with Colin Powell at his side, reading a prepared statement on Iraq. The coincidental timing of this pre-emptive press statement raised immediate questions about the motives of the White House war strategists. Students of the Civil Rights Movement will recall an incident in 1964 when activist Fannie Lou Hamer sat before a live television audience and gave a riveting account of the oppression she and other Blacks faced in the South. President Lyndon Johnson was so convinced of the power of her appeal to undermine his own political/racial agenda, that he hastily called a press conference to pull cameras away from Hamer's impassioned revelations. Though the networks pre- empted Hamer's testimony to cover the president, the newscasts later showed her entire presentation.</q> </p>

<p><q>The pre-emption of Winfrey's show today should be seen in the same light. Oprah's audience is a vast and powerful--but largely apolitical--force of middle-class white women. It is likely that most did not watch Colin Powell's live testimony at the <span class="caps">U.N. </span>yesterday. In fact, it is likely that this huge audience was being oriented to the issues of the Iraq war for the first time. Bush and his handlers are also aware that powerful Republican voices, including Rush Limbaugh's, credit Bush's pre-election appearance on the Oprah Show with "turning the tide" in his favor. It is unlikely that they treated this show with anything but intense propaganda interest.</q> </p>

<p> <q>The first 30 minutes of the show was decidedly anti-war and highlighted not only worldwide unanimity in opposition to the war but presented many of the heretofore unheard voices of ordinary people speaking forcefully against Bush's motives. <span class="caps">CNN </span>assisted the Oprah Show by presenting overseas confirmation of this from Great Britain and Iraq. For instance, the British correspondent said at one point that it was hard to find anyone in Britain <span class="caps">EXCEPT TONY BLAIR </span>that supported the war. Other voices repeated their conclusion that the war is "for oil," not "against terrorism." Those familiar with the Bush administration's network cheerleaders at <span class="caps">ABC, NBC, </span>and <span class="caps">CBS </span>would, no doubt, view this expose' with raised eyebrows. Then, without warning or introduction, Bush is seen at the podium reiterating Powell's statement at the <span class="caps">U.N. </span>yesterday! One immediately had to assume that Bush was actually declaring war on Iraq, given the urgency of this interruption. Soon, however, it became clear that <span class="caps">OPRAH </span>herself was the target of this sabre-rattling and not Saddam Hussein. Bush simply summarized Powell's presentation for Oprah's audience, hitting key emotional points for this afternoon women's gathering. He said nothing more of any import at all. Returning to the show, 15 or so minutes later, found still more impassioned, but reasoned, anti-war input from members of Oprah's audience. There was indeed a balance of pro-war input but the net effect of the show--in spite of Bush's strategic Johnsonian interruption--was to embolden the anti-war voices and to make opposition to the war as "patriotic" a position as that of the warmongers. What we just saw was a replay of an old propaganda ploy of an ol' Texas politician, Lyndon Baines Johnson, against the scarecropper's daughter from Mississippi, Fannie Lou Hamer. In 1964, enough of Hamer's message was heard to force Johnson into acting against his own political desires. Bush's ploy in 2003 may have backfired as well.</q></p>
