<h3 id="a005331">tooth fairy fails to show</h3>

<p> Well, we've taken advice from various sources now and Apoa has decided to give the fairy another chance. Unfortunately, her mum has got the tooth somewhere and she's only ever here for the odd moment every day just now. Must remember to get the tooth back and give it another go. Tomorrow Apoa (and the fairy) will have been waiting two weeks to finalise their transaction. Is this a record?</p>

<h3 id="a005330">valentine</h3>

<p>Ohna has been too busy to do any valentine's things</p>

<p>B-(</p>

<p>Apoa and Kiloh, on the other hand, have been very busy. They've been hiding in their rooms a lot recently and they were up at 6 this morning to deliver various items including handwritten cards and handmade hanging hearts. Apoa also left a cherry drop with a heart stuck on top of it by each of our beds.</p>

<h3 id="a005329">captain corelli</h3>

<p>Just read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099422042/">Captain Corelli's Mandolin</a>, part of a process of teaching myself to read bigger books (534 pages) and take longer over them (2 months). Obviously, he's a great writer and in the end I thought it was a great book. The main effect it had on me was to make me miserable by getting across a profound sense of the horror of war. The main things that struck me about his writing were how happy he was to digress and enjoy chapters and subplots and so on, regardless of how essential they were to moving the plot along. And, obviously connected, how strong a sense you get of him enjoying his writing. I enjoyed it too, although I had to struggle with the usual impatience that I was reading this book to train myself out of.</p>

<p>I followed the book by watching <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0238112">the film</a> on video. A lot of good things about it, despite the problems of having to reduce 534 pages and all those digressions to something more streamlined. I couldn't understand why they chose to get the actors to perform it in funny accents, though, and I giggled when they had the Italian soldiers singing while shaving rather than singing on the bog.</p>

<p>But I felt cheated by the much-happier-than-the-book ending. For me, this meant removing what was the most powerful thing in the book. I guess it's typical of movie adaptations, but I thought it was a real shame. Maybe they should have gone for a two-part <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0091288">Jean de Florette</a> kind of approach.</p>

<p>And one more thing, both the book and the film fail to raise questions about guilt surrounding the main characters which I would have thought inevitable given what happens in both the book and the film (I'm being inexplicit for the sake of anyone who hasn't seen or read either).</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<h3 id="a005328">get off the fence</h3>

<p>I get really fed up with the way arguments get polarised. In the Iraq thing, this means you can only be either for war (gung ho imperialistic swine) or against it (Saddam loving cheese eater).</p>

<p>Timothy Garton Ash wrote <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,889572,00.html">a good article</a> arguing against polarisation and explaining why he's on the fence about Iraq.</p>

<p>It's worth pointing out, though, that the people on one side of this argument are a lot more keen to polarise than the other. According to the US government, and a lot of other pro-war folk, you're either desperate to pull the trigger now and who cares what anyone else thinks or you're 'irrelevant', 'insignificant', 'pathetic' etc. etc. etc. Bush 2 began all this with his 'if you're not with us you're against us' speech - what Chomsky described as the <span class="caps">USA </span>declaring war on the world.</p>

<p>The other thing that strikes me is that the reasons Garton Ash gives against the war are much stronger than the ones he gives for it.</p>
