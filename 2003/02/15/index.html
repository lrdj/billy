<h3 id="a005333">half a demo</h3>

<p>Well, we're home already.</p>

<p>The kids declared war on each other before we even left the house, which was not a good omen. Their friend Guy was bringing his catapult on the march so he could sort out any Iraqis he might meet. Not sure he's really with the programme.</p>

<p>We waited at Finsbury Park for half an hour then tubed to Russell Square. An hour and a half later we'd made it to Bedford Square and at that point I gave in and took the kids home.</p>

<p>We enjoyed the bit we joined in on though. The kids were impressed by the noise every time a wave of shouting passed through the crowd and we enjoyed various chants, banners, drummers, and stuff. I enjoyed being out in a crowd of amiable grownups. I had more conversations with strangers in two hours than I usually manage in a month, including people on the tube who weren't going to the demo.</p>

<p>I would have liked to see Hyde Park but at least we got a taste of it all. And I don't suppose this is the last such demo we'll ever see...</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<h3 id="a005332">madhouse</h3>

<p>Ohna's at work, six kids are running riot in my house, I've just about got the lunches together. Someone's at the door. Oops, must dash. We've got a war to stop.</p>
