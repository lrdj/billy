<h2>February 17, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005335">licensed to drive too fast</h3>

<p>First day of half-term. I just took Apoa, Kiloh and Oisin to the <a href="http://www.jamesbondexhibition.com">007 exhibition</a> at the Science Museum. I was a bit disappointed as the main event was queueing up to answer questions on computer screens, something that's easier to do if you're sitting at home. What interested me most were the design drawings and storyboards, but it's hard to look at them properly when you've got three kids to look after (and to help with the quiz questions on their monitors). I was also less than impressed that the <cite>'death-defying stunt'</cite> they promised meant holding onto a girder and looking at yourself on a screen clinging on to the Golden Gate bridge. The effect was slightly spoiled by the poor quality of the image and the fact that other folk in the room were walking around in the sky behind you. Oh well.</p>

<p>It was also interesting to head into town on the first day of congestion charging. The tubes didn't seem any busier than usual (although I don't use them that often) but crossing roads with kids in South Kensington made clear what I think is the main flaw with the scheme. If the scheme <cite>'works'</cite> then traffic will be able to get around faster. The last thing we want cars to do is to speed up. Up until now, the scariest bit about cycling in London has been being passed by cars going too fast and passing too close. This is usually less of a problem in town than our here in the boondocks. Hope this scheme isn't going to change that. I've always thought that banning cars altogether is the best way to deal with traffic, but maybe this is just the first step?</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p><q>hi billy - just reading the blog listening to the free cd on this month's muzik mag - a mix by Gilles Peterson - definitely worth the 3 pounds 65, especially considering the first track's in Finnish</q></p>
