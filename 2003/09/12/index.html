<h3 id="a005482">the dark house</h3>

<p>I forgot to mention that Donald Davidson also climbed mountains and wrote radio plays (some of which featured Edward G. Robinson). I wonder what he'd have made of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/darkhouse/index.shtml">The Dark House</a>?</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<h3 id="a005480">Ballad of a Teenage Queen</h3>

<p> Those lyrics take ages to load, so here they are (sorry I couldn't be bothered to make them lay themselves out properly):</p>

<p>Ballad Of A Teenage Queen</p>

<p>Artist: Johnny Cash (peak Billboard position # 14 in 1958)</p>

<p>Words and Music by Jack H. Clement</p>

<p>(Dream on, dream on teenage queen prettiest girl we've ever seen) There's a story in our town Of the prettiest girl around Golden hair and eyes of blue How those eyes could flash at you (How those eyes could flash at you) Boys hung 'round her by the score But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store (Dream on, dream on teenage queen prettiest girl we've ever seen)</p>

<p>She was tops in all they said It never once went to her head She had everything it seems Not a care, this teenage queen (Not a care, this teenage queen) Other boys could offer more But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store (Dream on, dream on teenage queen you should be a movie queen)</p>

<p>He would marry her next spring Saved his money, bought a ring Then one day a movie scout Came to town to take her out (Came to town to take her out) Hollywood could offer more So she left the boy next door working at the candy store (Dream on, dream on teenage queen see you on the movie screen)</p>

<p>Very soon she was a star Pretty house and shiny car Swimming pool and a fence around But she missed her old home town (But she missed her old home town) All the world was at her door All except the boy next door who worked at the candy store (Dream on, dream on teenage queen saddest girl we've ever seen)</p>

<p>Then one day the teenage star Sold her house and all her cars Gave up all her wealth and fame Left it all and caught a train (Left it all and caught a train) Do I have to tell you more She came back to the boy next door who worked at the candy store (Now this story has some more, you'll hear it all at the candy store)</p>

<h3 id="a005479">Johnny Cash</h3>

<p>Just heard that he died. The first thing that immediately springs to mind about him is his music. I was listening to an early song by him recently called 'Ballad of a Teenage Queen' (lyrics <a href="http://www.lyricsxp.com/lyrics/b/ballad_of_a_teenage_queen_johnny_cash.html">here</a>) which I'd love to make a promo video for, and we were all enjoying the most recent Rick Rubin-produced album last Christmas. The second thing I remember is how he told an audience he had Parkinson's Disease. Apparently, he dropped his plectrum and then nearly fell over trying to pick it up. When he said he had Parkinson's the audience laughed, thinking it was a joke, and he replied 'It ain't funny. But it's all right. I refuse to give it some ground in my life'</p>

<p>They're just talking about him on <a href="http://www.xfm.co.uk">xfm</a> right now.</p>
