<h3 id="a005498">devon swingers</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.affairsltd.com/devonswingersswinging.htm">This</a> is for anyone who thought <a href="http://www.budleigh-salterton-guide.co.uk/">Budleigh Salterton</a> was boring. Jed and Ruth have never mentioned this, and they also kept pretty quiet about the nudist beach for a long time (apparently, the closer you get to Exmouth the wilder it gets). I found this after discovering that 'budleigh salterton nudist beach' was a search phrase which led some surfers to the <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org">Lecture List</a> page.</p>

<h3 id="a005497">egg heads, noise addicts and pain freaks</h3>

<p> According to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/experimental/reviews/ blackdice_beaches.shtml"><span class="caps">BBC</span> Black Dice review</a> Jonathan mentioned, these are the groups who will <q>clutch this to their hearts</q>. I've now heard two 29-second excerpts and it sounds good to me. I find you can enjoy it through headphones which you're not even wearing, which is kinda special.</p>

<h3 id="a005496">Jonathan's in love</h3>

<p>Jonathan says:</p>

<p>hi, how are you doing - thought I should let you know about Black Dice, who you may already know about. I'm currently in love with <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/experimental/reviews/blackdice_beaches.shtml">their album</a> and <a href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/phoenix/1999/1999-11-19/living/wu.html">this</a> is a review of one of their gigs from a while back.</p>

<h3 id="a005495">My Computer Told Me To Do It</h3>

<p>Today's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/afternoonplay.shtml">afternoon play</a> is written and directed by Jim Poyser, so it's bound to be good, and funny.</p>

<h3 id="a005494">Vicky's accent</h3>

<p> Just got back on track with Eastenders in time for Dirty Den's return. They've just done a really bizarre thing with Vicky's accent. Vicky is Michelle's daughter, born and raised in the states, who recently came back to the square to hang out with her half sister and who now also lives with her recently discovered half brother (who, btw, has sexual feelings towards the other half sister, which she half shares but is in denial about), who is about to meet her long-presumed-dead father who didn't die in the canal a couple of decades ago after all. (God, it's like a bleedin soap opera, innit?)</p>

<p>Anyway, Vicky (who is apparently a graduate of the Mountview Theatre School down the road from us) has just come back to the square after going home and then visiting Europe for a bit and her accent has suddenly changed to a slightly weird version of an English one. I need to re-view the omnibus to hear the exact exchange but one of the characters commented on it and she gave a reply which suggested that this was something she decided to do since she had decided to fit in. Since then we've noticed a very English 'a' in 'can't' and then a self-correction when she said was going to 'see a movie' and then tutted and changed it to 'going to the cinema'. Does anybody else find all of this just a wee bit unrealistic?</p>
