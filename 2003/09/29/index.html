<h2>September 29, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005506">comics for growns</h3>

<p>Did a few fun things this weekend, including skating with Kiloh and her friend Sally, who hurt her feet because her socks were too short. Hope they're mending now. Also went to see a tribute to Peter Tinniswood at the <span class="caps">NFT, </span>which was fun, although I was expecting a bit more talking than we got.</p>

<p>But the highlight of the weekend was visiting our little local library where I not only became a hero by getting <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0298203/">8 Mile</a> out but also discovered that they now stock graphic novels (OK, comic books). The first thing you see as you come in the door are rows of brand new books just waiting to be borrowed. I started by getting a collection of rare and not so rare work by R Crumb called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0747553092/qid%3D1064843029/">Odds and Ends</a>, a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1560974583/qid%3D1064843155/">Daniel Clowes collection</a> that I haven't read yet and the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1840233028/qid%3D1064843237/">League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a> which I also haven't read yet but feel I should before that awful-looking film comes out and ruins everything.</p>

<h3 id="a005505">Raising Victor Vargas</h3>

<p><a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0316188/">Raising Victor Vargas</a> does have a lot in common with <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0113540/">Kids</a>. New York, sex-obsessed kids, realism, realistic dialogue, good performances, a swimming pool,... But it's much less gruesome, with no <span class="caps">HIV</span>-related plot or anything. Believe it or not, it's also got a lot in common with <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0163651/">American Pie</a>. It's more realistic and not over-the-top/cartoony, but the characters have a similar innocence and the same obsession with sex. And there's one clear echo, which might or might not be deliberate, when one of the female characters tells her man that he is 'my bitch'.</p>
