<h3 id="a005504">movie massacre</h3>

<p>There's an interesting little story about film in the interview with Emo Philips in this week's Friday Thing:</p>

<p><q>In his absence, some of you may have seen his name attached to the Robert De Niro/Ben Stiller farce 'Meet the Parents'. You probably thought, that must be nice for Emo. But no.</q></p>

<p><q>Philips made a film called 'Meet the Parents' for &pound;22,000 in 1991 - which he showed at Edinburgh, and at the <span class="caps">NFT </span>and which got rave reviews on the arts pages. Universal bought the remake rights and then, seven years later, butchered it in the remake.</q></p>

<p><q>'They put my name on the film in the same way we name streets after Indians we've massacred,' he explains. 'I haven't been to the cinema since. I hated the ending. In mine, everyone died. But then, mine was a film and theirs was a movie. In a film, anything can happen. In a movie, you know exactly what's going to happen. But I've learnt my lesson. I'm not planning to do any more movies. I know my limitations. I'm a good stand-up. A lot of my contemporaries are now writing gags for sitcoms. That's rather like giving up bullfighting and becoming a meat packer.'</q></p>

<h3 id="a005503">Mr. Arkadin</h3>

<p>Went to see a fairly mad Orson Welles movie last night called <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0048393/">Mr. Arkadin</a>, also known as 'Confidential Report' (I seem to be on a run of movies with more than one title). It started off reminding me of the backwards Seinfeld episode but the film it most reminded us of was <a href="htpp://us.imdb.com/title/tt0046414">Beat The Devil</a>, which it was even more hammy than and not as consistently entertaining as (ooh, dangling prepositions, you won't tell, will you?). It was so over the top that it was hard to take seriously and the main character was really horrible, so it wasn't really that engaging, but there were still some fun scenes, including a really funny turn by Michael Redgrave.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Geoff wanted to show me the architecture in Southwark tube station. When we asked if I could go in for a look and come out again, they sold me a platform ticket for 40p, which was quite exciting (you have to come out again within 70 minutes). The station is definitely worth seeing, btw, but the best way is to take the tube there and start from the platform.</p>
