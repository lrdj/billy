<h3 id="a005492">lyrics</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com">dug</a> occasionally posts a message about pop lyrics. I still don't know which song <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/permalinker/?pid=11349&amp;blog=donkey">the last lot</a> came from.</p>

<p>But I've been having fun reading the <a href="http://www.alwaysontherun.net/ct2.htm">lyrics to Violaine</a> by the Cocteau Twins. For the full effect, you need to be listening while reading them, of course.</p>

<h3 id="a005489">Closure of Linguistics at Durham</h3>

<p> This is really sad news from the linguistics department at Durham, which is definitely one of the best in the country.</p>

<p><q>Dear Colleagues,</q></p>

<p><q>Last June we announced the proposals by the University of Durham to close its highly successful and internationally respected Department of Linguistics and English Language. We have been very gratified over the past three months with the amount of support and solidarity we have been shown by the linguistics community in general and the <span class="caps">LAGB </span>in particular. University administrators themselves have commented that they were surprised by the number of letters they received on our behalf.</q></p>

<p><q>Nevertheless, the university administration has chosen to ignore our research rating, our teaching excellence, our international standing and the arguments of the worldwide community of linguists. It is with deep regret that we let you know that the University Executive Council has decided to close the Department of Linguistics and English Language at the University of Durham. No redeployment is being proposed, although negotiations are apparently in progress with the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, with a view to transferring the linguists at Durham to that institution. However, that move would obviously require the full support (including financial backing) of <span class="caps">HEFCE, </span>and as yet we have no idea whether that will be forthcoming.</q></p>

<p><q>We will keep the list informed of any further developments. Once again, we would like to express our heartfelt thanks to all our supporters.</q></p>
