<h3 id="a005476">punks in science</h3>

<p>Just had an email from Kleanthes, one of the founders of <a href="http://www.punksinscience.org/">punksinscience</a>, who wanted to know whether I was 'the crazy guy with a bike' (I was) and whether I cycled all the way from Middlesex to Bangor (not quite).</p>

<p> B-)</p>

<h3 id="a005475">donald davidson obituary</h3>

<p>Donald Davidson was quite a guy. The Guardian had a good obituary of him which you can find <a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,9830,1035408,00.html">here</a> and there was one in the New York Times which is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/04/obituaries/04DAVI.html">here</a> (you need to subscribe to read it, but subscription is free)</p>

<p>When I started working on Davidson I had imagined him to be less interesting than Descartes, the other philosopher I've just been writing about, but as you'll see I was wrong. He wasn't just a philosopher but also a skier, surfer, glider pilot, electronics buff (building radios and tellies for fun), radio ham, amateur dramatist, and a friend of Leonard Bernstein who he duetted with on the piano and who wrote the music for his student production of 'The Birds' (Aristophanes, not Hitchcock). He travelled Europe in the 30s and was later shocked to think that he and his friends had treated the Nazis as a bit of a joke. At the time, he and his friends were 'dupes of the Communist party line' as he put it himself.</p>

<p>I found most of these things out reading his intellectual autobigraphy in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/081269399X/">this book</a>, which is unfortunately reprinting right now so you'll have to go to the library if you want to read it.</p>

<p>I particularly enjoyed reading about his romantic adventures. He seems to have had a thing for exotic names. The love interests he mentions include Dolores Dewilder (when he was around 11, other kids would try to tease him by writing 'DD loves <span class="caps">DD' </span>all over the place while he ignored them and went back to 'smooching' in his hammock), Lola Borgemeister, Tatiana Riabouchinska, Tamara Toumanova and Shirley Bernstein, Leonard's sister. He decided not to follow up his interest in Shirley when Leonard threatened to kill him 'if you do anything with my sister'. 'Those were the days', is Davidson's comment.</p>

<h3 id="a005474">back in one piece</h3>

<p>Actually, I've been back for a while now but too lazy to get back to writing anything here.</p>

<p>The biggest event on holiday was the accident we had on the French motorway. We had a blowout and wrote our car off, but all of us were miraculously unhurt. We each wrote an account of it so I'll post our version of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042876/">Rashomon</a> when I get time (OK, if).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I was just finishing my essay on Donald Davidson when I discovered that <a href="http://webapp.utexas.edu/blogs/archives/bleiter/000206.html" >he died</a>. It's sad news but of course I now need to read the obituaries before being able to say the essay is completely finished. As ever, the bloggers were the first to say anything public about it. <a href="http://www.cddc.vt.edu/jeremy/blog/2003/08/31.html#a1091">Here</a> is one place to start looking at them. B-)</p>
