<h2>September 22, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a005493">play</h3>

<p>Had a good weekend with <a href="http://www.r.bushe.dial.pipex.com/">Robbie</a>. Ohna and Kiloh were away camping and Apoa had a number of engagements so it was good to have some company. It was Open House Weekend so we had a look in St. Pancras Chambers, which used to be a big posh hotel and is about to be redeveloped into ... a big posh hotel. Also had fun at a comedy night on Saturday. I had my mind read and Robbie got picked on a wee bit (so you're single? since? did she dump you or did you dump her? somebody else? that's even worse, isn't it?) The main act were <a href="http://www.menincoats.co.uk">Men In Coats</a> who do really good visual comedy, even if they did repeatedly fire a water pistol in my face for a few seconds.</p>

<p>I'm off now (well, not actually moving, but you know) to listen to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/afternoonplay.shtml">Afternoon Play</a> on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/">Radio 4</a>. It's 'Occasional Swim' by Annie McCartney who's really good. The website says:</p>

<p><q> Rosa and Colm meet at their local pool, and romance soon blossoms. But Colm's past requires more than a little explanation.</q></p>

<p>The thing about the guy with a past is really typical of Annie McCartney's work, which often has to do with people working out what the deal is with other people (and often getting it wrong at first).</p>

<p>For some reason, I'm suddenly thinking of the gun in the drawer when David Hunter first moved into the Crossroads Motel, but her stuff is in a whole different universe from that, of course.</p>

<p>B-)</p>
