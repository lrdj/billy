<p>I'm not sure how accurate these things are. Our scan photo of Apoa showed her wearing my specs and reading a book.</p>

<h3 id="a005309">way to go, wombat</h3>

<p>Holly sent me this:</p>

<p><q>Three US Airforce bases in East Anglia inspected in a month</q></p>

<p><q>Weapons Inspectors arrested at <span class="caps">RAF</span> Feltwell</q></p>

<p><q>At 16:30 on Friday 10th January, a delegation of 5 weapons inspectors from Cambridge Students Against the War entered <span class="caps">RAF</span> Feltwell, to confirm reports that the base forms part of a US Weapons of Mass Destruction development programme. Amongst other concerns, the inspectors believe the base is assisting in target acquisition for the expected US attacks on Iraq.</q></p>

<p><q>Inspectors entered through the main gate, much to the surprise of the guards, and continued into the base, collecting evidence of activities carried out on the site. The watching US soldiers were powerless to do anything but close the gates to the most sensitive areas and await the military police. Hindered in their progress, the inspectors asked to speak to the <span class="caps">RAF </span>personnel nominally in charge of the installation, but it turned out to be entirely in American hands. They then demanded that the base commander and his family be removed from the country for questioning.</q></p>

<p><q>However, authorities at the base failed to comply with requests for cooperation and the weapons inspectors were arrested as they left the site. The 4 person support team was then arrested across the road from the main entrance and a vehicle was impounded. All were taken to police stations in Norfolk and Suffolk and released without charge 6- 8 hours later. One was ordered to report back to the station in the next few days.</q> </p>

<p><q>A total of three East Anglian US Airforce bases (Feltwell, Lakenheath, and Mildenhall) have now been inspected within the last month - apart from anything else revealing an astonishing lack of security at bases storing weaponry including suspected nuclear weapons. Interviewed after his release, inspector 'Spikey' said, 'Unfortunately, all our findings confirm local fears that East Anglia is being conscripted into US military programmes without any democratic discussion or accountability. The presence of nuclear weapons is not only illegal and immoral, it also makes this area a potential target for enemies of the <span class="caps">US.'</span></q> </p>

<p><q>The base at Feltwell is run by the US Air Force as part of a network of 'near-space tracking facilities'. These tracking facilities are part of US attempts to militarise space. Details of these <span class="caps">USAF </span>plans can be found on their website <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/jv2020/">here</a> . The plan - known as 'Vision 2020' - states that 'space forces will emerge to protect military and commercial interests and investment in the space medium...' Feltwell also plays an important role as an electronic warfare and surveillance site - surveillance equipment at Feltwell is used as part of an ongoing US National Security Agency effort to monitor commercial, personal, and military electronic communications (phone, email, and radio) worldwide - for more information, see the Guardian story <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/europarl/Story/0,2763,498440,00.html"> here</a></q> </p>

<p><q><span class="caps">RAF</span> Lakenheath is the largest US Air Force-operated base in England, and the most important tactical nuclear bombing base in Europe. The 48th Fighter Wing at Lakenheath is the US Air Force in Europe's only F-15 Fighter Wing. It has a long history of use in the Gulf, being the first F-111 fighter unit to deploy in the First Gulf War in 1991, and was involved in bombing in 1998 and since. <span class="caps">NATO </span>and <span class="caps">U.S. </span>leaders have asserted that if America is needed again in this region, the 48th Fighter Wing will be called out first (see <a href="http://www.lakenheath.af.mil/Mission- history/index.html">here</a>)</q> </p>

<p><q><span class="caps">RAF</span> Mildenhall, just 20 miles from Cambridge, is a staging post for US flights to Europe. This includes the nuclear weapons based in Europe under the <span class="caps">NATO </span>nuclear sharing agreement. The US Air Force runs aerial refuelling, special operations, air mobility, reconnaissance and intelligence out of <span class="caps">RAF</span> Mildenhall. The base's website asserts that <span class="caps">RAF</span> Mildenhall is used by the US Air Force to provide 'global power and global reach. Anytime. Anywhere.'.</q> </p>

<p><q>Both Lakenheath and Mildenhall are seeing massive increases in air traffic as <span class="caps">USAF </span>transport, bomber, and fighter aircraft are funnelled towards their deployment in the Persian Gulf region ready for attacks on Iraq.</q> </p>

<p><q>CamSAW supporter Nick Gill, hearing the news of the inspections, said, 'The weapons inspectors should be commended for seeking to apply the same standards to the East Anglian air bases as are currently being applied in Iraq. In the event of war on Iraq, the so- called <span class="caps">RAF </span>bases will be used to inflict horrendous casualties on the innocent people of Iraq. This cannot be allowed to happen.'</q> </p>

<p><q>Asked about the value of such actions, inspector 'Wombat' said, 'While these inspections were planned with a sense of humour, they send a signal that the anti-war movement is absolutely serious about opposing this unjustifiable war. People all over the country are organising demonstrations, vigils, die-ins, sit-downs, base incursions, and much more. We will not have Iraq destroyed in our names. These actions are just the beginning.'</q> </p>

<p><q>24 MPs have signed an Early Day Motion supporting the Lakenheath inspection on 12th December. The text and signatories can be seen <a href="http://edm.ais.co.uk/weblink/html/motion.html/ref=435 ">here</a></q></p>

<p><q>Cambridge Students Against the War (CamSAW) was founded as a response to <span class="caps">USA'</span>s 'war on terror' and attack on Afghanistan in 2001. With another unjustified war imminent, this coalition of students from Cambridge University, Anglia Polytechnic University and local higher education and sixth form colleges is continuing to plan actions. More information and some photos can be found at www.camsaw.org.uk </q></p>
