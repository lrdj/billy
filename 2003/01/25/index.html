<h3 id="a005314">words from Rabbie</h3>

<p> <q>Address to the Unco Guid.</q> <q>My Son, these maxims make a rule, An lump them ay thegither: The Rigid Righteous is a fool, The Rigid Wise anither; The cleanest corn that e'er was dight May hae some pyles o caff in; So ne'er a fellow-creature slight For random fits o daffin.</q></p>

<p><q>O ye, wha are sae guid yoursel, Sae pious and sae holy, Ye've nought to do but mark and tell Your neebours' fauts and folly! Whase life is like a weel-gaun mill, Supplied wi store o water; The heapet happer's ebbing still, An still the clap plays clatter!</q></p>

<p><q>Hear me, ye venerable core, As counsel for poor mortals That frequent pass douce Wisdom's door For glaikit Folly's portals: I for their thoughtless, careless sakes, Would here propone defences - Their donsie tricks, their black mistakes, Their failings and mischances.</q></p>

<p><q>Ye see your state wi theirs compared, And shudder at the niffer; But cast a moment's fair regard, What makes the mighty differ? Discount what scant occasion gave; That purity ye pride in; And (what's aft mair than a' the lave) Your better art o hidin.</q></p>

<p><q>Think, when your castigated pulse Gies now and then a wallop, What ragings must his veins convulse, That still eternal gallop! Wi wind and tide fair i your tail, Right on ye scud your sea-way; But in the teeth o baith to sail, It makes an unco lee-way</q></p>

<p><q>See Social Life and Glee sit down, All joyous and unthinking, Till, quite transmugrify'd, they're grown Debauchery and Drinking: O, would they stay to calculate Th' eternal consequences, Or your more dreaded hell to state - Damnation of expenses!</q></p>

<p><q>Ye high, exalted, virtuous dames, Tied up in godly laces, Before ye gie poor Frailty names, Suppose a change o cases: A dear-lov'd lad, convenience snug, A treach'rous inclination - But, let me whisper in your lug, Ye're aiblins nae temptation.</q></p>

<p><q>Then gently scan your brother man, Still gentler sister woman; Tho they may gang a kennin wrang, To step aside is human: One point must still be greatly dark, The moving Why they do it; And just as lamely can ye mark, How far perhaps they rue it.</q></p>

<p><q>Who made the heart, 'tis He alone Decidedly can try us: He knows each chord, its various tone, Each spring, its various bias: Then at the balance let's be mute, We never can adjust it; What's done we partly may compute, But know not what's resisted.</q></p>

<h3 id="a005313">the star o rabbie burns</h3>

<p> Jennifer writes:</p>

<p><q>I hope you're doing sth in honour of our national poet this weekend. (no, not McGonagall, but I fear Tay Bridge Disaster may get an airing at my gaff the morn's night).</q></p>

<p><q>Jonathan is charged with a toast to the lassies, and being a fairly literary type, has done something iambic or euphoric or something. He should just stick to Cock up yer Beaver and other such Rabbie classics.</q></p>

<p>For once, I'm not involved in a Burns night. But I am going to dinner with <span class="caps">J.R.</span> Firth's grandson. I will wear my kilt, though, and maybe give them a bit of a recital.</p>

<h3 id="a005312">what the war will bring</h3>

<p> Hope that modal is wrong. Robert writes:</p>

<p><q>The satire on this website may be beneath your dignity but it works for me:</q></p>
