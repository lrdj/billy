<h3 id="a005304">an open letter</h3>

<p> Geoff Pullum just told <a href="http://linguistlist.org/"><span class="caps">LINGUIST</span></a> about this letter he sent to Ricoh:</p>

<p><q>December 30, 2002</q></p>

<p><q>Dear Mr Ivy,</q></p>

<p><q>The Ricoh Corporation's advertisement on page 2 of The Economist Technology Quarterly [insert following page 48 of The Economist, Dec. 14--20, 2002] shows a picture of a Khoi tribal leader named Chief Obijol. The legend reads:</q></p>

<p><q>'With a series of simple clicking sounds, he can teach a force of 200 men to hunt, to treat an illness, even how to find an appropriate mate.'</q></p>

<p><q>This is not the first time I have read racist nonsense about the hunters of the Kalahari desert just clicking and grunting at each other rather than using a proper language with sentences like the rest of us. Your corporation and its advertising agency should be ashamed of repeating such stupidness.</q></p>

<p><q>The ad makes an unobjectionable point: for explaining traditions and skills to a couple of hundred people in the face-to-face context of a hunter-gatherer tribe, oral communication in a human language 'works exceedingly well,' it says; but for the kind of communication involved in running a large modern business one needs document and image sharing of the sort Ricoh offers. The trouble is all with the unnecessarily demeaning and offensive way the first part is put. It makes Khoi-speaking people sound more like exotic animals than like human beings speaking a human language.</q></p>

<p><q>The Khoi people of Southwestern Africa do not communicate in 'a series of simple clicking sounds.' Their languages are ordinary human languages with the same kinds of complexities as are found in English grammar. It's true that Khoi languages have velaric suction consonants that are informally described as sounding like clicks, but they are merely consonants, and they occur with vowels and more ordinary non-click consonants in syllables, words, phrases, and sentences as in any other human language. To refer to Chief Obijol's speech as 'a series of simple clicking sounds' is as stupid as calling your own speech 'a series of simple uh sounds.'</q></p>

<p><q>I will be sharing this letter with the 16,500 linguists who subscribe to The Linguist List as well as the editor of The Economist. I very much hope you will share it with the people at your advertising agency who did this to you.</q></p>

<p><q>Sincerely,</q></p>

<p><q>Geoffrey K. Pullum</q> <q>Professor of Linguistics</q></p>

<h3 id="a005303">eliza the chatterbot</h3>

<p>Yesterday was Joseph Weizenbaum's 80th birthday. He created Eliza, the world's first chatterbot.</p>

<p>Eliza was the first computer who could have conversations with humans. She had no idea what words meant but she knew a few tricks that could fool you into thinking she did. Apparently, there are also some psychiatrists who have learned how to do this.</p>

<p><a href="http://tecsoc.org/pubs/history/2003/jan8.htm">Here</a> is some info about the pair of them from <a href="http://tecsoc.org/">tecsoc</a></p>
