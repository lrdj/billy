<h3 id="a005264">grammar for writing</h3>

<p>Have a look <a href="http://www.lang.ltsn.ac.uk/lings/linggrammar.html">here</a> if you're interested in the ongoing debate about grammar teaching in schools. I'm off to spend the afternoon discussing this along with questions about linguistics in education more generally. One particular question we'll be discussing is whether grammar teaching can help kids with their writing. What do you think?</p>

<h3 id="a005263">bastarding bastard of bastards</h3>

<p>Top <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardianpolitics/story/0,3605,834385,0 0.html">piece</a> by Simon Hoggart today. It's hard to pick one bit to quote at you cos it's all so funny. But here's one little extract:</p>

<p><q>Another [Tory MP] said, 'That bastard was the most disloyal bastard of all the bastards John Major had to cope with. And do you know why? Because he's a bastard!'</q></p>

<p><q>'Come off the fence and tell me what you really think!' I wanted to cry. </q></p>

<p>B-))</p>

<h3 id="a005262">the town that was lost at sea</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.jobbles.demon.co.uk/">Jed</a> drew my attention to this seriously depressing <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/story.jsp?story=347861">article</a> about the drug problem in Fraserburgh. My mum and sister live just along the coast from <cite>'The Broch'</cite>, as the locals call it, and my niece is in Fraserburgh hospital with her new baby boy as I write. I knew things were bad there, but one misjudgement I'd made was to infer that things were bad everywhere rather than that Fraserburgh was particularly bad. It doesn't make the situation any worse but it somehow makes me feel worse about it.</p>

<p>By the way, does anyone know how many 'drug capitals' various countries have? Scotland, Britain and Europe all seem to have quite a few. Is it that the charts keep changing or is it that there is more than one chart?</p>

<p>B-(</p>
