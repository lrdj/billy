<h3 id="a005279">good radio news</h3>

<p>Peter Tinniswood is a bit of a god among radio dramatists, and his work is always inventive linguistically as well as in other ways. He wrote today's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/afternoonplay.shtml">afternoon play</a>. The extra good news is that you can now <cite>'listen again'</cite> to the afternoon plays for seven days after they're broadcast. So you've got until next Tuesday to catch it if you missed it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.samizdata.net/blog/archives/002315.html">samizdata</a > discusses this poster which has been appearing all over London. So spooky that some non-Londoners thought it was a joke. But I can confirm it's true. I've even picked up a leaflet which I've carefully analysed and I can confirm that it contains no markers of irony whatsoever.</p>

<h3 id="a005277">going through the motions</h3>

<p>Sadly, I might be the only person left who didn't see Buffy's famous <a href="http://www.upn.com/shows/buffy/episodes/season06/show_07.shtml"> musical episode</a>. Luckily, this meant I was in for a treat yesterday.</p>

<p>After the massage Ohna treated me to, where I not only got my back a good seeing to but also found out more than anyone needs to about building and racing bicycles and motorbikes, including a few tips for motorbike pursuits (<a href="http://www.alfiecox.co.za/">Alfie Cox</a> for a groovy biking holiday in South Africa, <a href="http://www.adventure-motorcycling.com/mcy/mcy04.htm">Si Pavey</a> in this country, <cite>'a wet weekend in Wales won't prepare you for Dakar'</cite>) and the shocking news that they have traffic cops specifically out to catch speeding cyclists in Richmond Park (speed limit is 17mph), and after a visit to <a href="http://www.ivormairants.co.uk/">Ivor Mairants</a> where I got to play for as long as I liked with some extremely beautiful guitars by Amalio Burguet, Manuel Rodriguez and others, I visited the getting-ever-more-popular cafe in the basement of Virgin, which now has listening posts and really old computer games like Galaxians and stuff on the tables. I've always been a fan of the Virgin cafe, which used to be upstairs and next door. The new version is pretty ugly as an environment but I enjoy the functions.</p>

<p>Anyway, imagine my delight as I found a listening post with the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000070WPE/qid=1037786022/">soundtrack</a> to the Buffy musical episode (aka <cite>Once More With Feeling</cite>) and got to discover what all the fuss is about.</p>

<p>It made me wonder whether there's anyone left out there who still thinks that the nation with the most well-developed sense of irony on the planet doesn't get irony. (I mean people who really think it rather than just people who say it ironically). I have heard a theory that presidential election results are affected by people who just can't resist voting for the most absurd candidate, as their sense of humour makes them forget how serious the consequences can be...</p>

<h3 id="a005276">(don't) say the word</h3>
