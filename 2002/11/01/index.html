<h3 id="a005259">thoughts from a 'jobless blackspot'</h3>

<p><a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/economics/story/0,11268,82415 7,00.html">Told you</a>.</p>

<p>Is it just me or do you think there's something a bit simplistic in the conclusion he draws from noticing 3,500 unemployed people in Tottenham and 4,000 vacancies in nearby jobcentres?</p>

<h3 id="a005258">Gore Vidal</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.otherlanguages.org">Mark</a> writes:</p>

<p><q>Dear Billy,</q></p>

<p><q>I enjoyed the paragraph where you cycle locally but worry globally - interesting to see Gore Vidal is on the case with September 11th.</q></p>

<p><q>That there were plans to bomb Afghanistan before then is fairly clear now, but if he can prove that extra claim the administration sat on its hands as the hijackers approached, that would be serious for Americans, wouldn't it? Making Bush into a sort of SuperNixon.</q></p>

<p><q>I can imagine Vidal alone might have the connections and tenacity to follow that one through, terrier-like, all the way down the tunnel. Since I'm in exile, I can't buy that Observer - did you get that issue to read his full claims?</q></p>

<p><q>Cheers, Mark</q></p>

<p>I did read the article but I didn't keep it. I wonder if <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com">dug</a> kept a copy?</p>

<h3 id="a005257">toffee apples are SO delicious!</h3>

<p> The kids did notice more than the sweets. On the way to school this morning, I listened to ten minutes on the delights of the Nicholas Nickleby (our local pub) and all the other sweets they scored. Then they moved on to eggs and things. Kiloh told Aidan that <cite>'some people were kicking old men all over the place!'</cite></p>

<h3 id="a005256">unemployment solution?</h3>

<p>I'm just off to Tottenham to do some work and I've heard that in <a href=" http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardianpolitics/story/0,3605,823744,00.html ">today's speech</a> Gordon Brown (our chancellor, i.e. the guy who spends our money for us) will be picking on Tottenham as a place with over 3,000 unemployed people even though there are jobs in other bits of London they could do. Why doesn't he send them all to University? I've heard there are some good ones in London full of teachers sitting around just waiting for someone to teach.</p>

<h3 id="a005255">urban halloween</h3>

<p>So, if you ask the kids I was with tonight what halloweeen was like, they'll tell you it was fun and that they scored loads of sweets.</p>

<p>If you ask the grownups, they'll also tell you it was fun. But they might also mention that three houses they visited had had eggs chucked at their front door, that two pumpkins on the doorstep of Jessie's house were smashed to bits (Jessie and the other kids who live there will tell you how <cite>'two of our pumpkins <span class="caps">EXPLODED</span>!'</cite>), that they watched five guys kicking the shit out of someone and when they checked it out they found the five guys were workmen and that the other guy had been trying to steal stuff off of their van (a 'pick-up' kind of thing so you could just take stuff off the top without any 'breaking and entering'), that when we were in the local pub (the kids trick-or-treated the pub and found tables of sweets there waiting for them) they heard the same guys boasting about how enjoyable it was to feel their feet connect with the thief's face, that they saw a woman walking down the street talking to her mobile in tears while a kid from the gang who had traumatised her followed her asking <cite>'are you all right?'</cite> while his mates yelled after him to <cite>'fucking come back here, you fucking idiot!'</cite> (none of these kids could have been over 12 years old), and so on. Rashomon!</p>

<p>Reminds me of the moment at woodcraft when we sent the kids into a patch of woodland (left there by a <span class="caps">WWII </span>bomb) to find green sticks for marshmallows and the leader of the session had to explain to the naive 6-9 year old kids that they might find things there that they should <cite>'NOT <span class="caps">TOUCH</span>!'</cite>, i.e. condoms and syringes.</p>
