<h3 id="a005286">why they're not returning your calls</h3>

<p>Our family is partly American, so we do thanksgiving, but we're compromising by doing it on Saturday. You can find out why Americans (apart from turkeys and native Americans, and ...) are giving thanks <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,603237,00.html ">here</a></p>

<h3 id="a005285">take the skinheads bowling</h3>

<p> Remember <a href="http://www.campervanbeethoven.com/">Camper Van Beethoven</a>? <cite>'Take the skinheads bowling'</cite> is the blindingly obvious choice as opening number in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0310793">Bowling For Columbine</a>. It's blindingly obvious and it's low budget (sound quality really pretty poor) but still great to hear it again. And that pretty much sums up the movie too. The question it asked was: what is it about Americans that makes them go around killing each other? The big surprise for me was that the answer isn't just that there are too many guns. (Canada being the big counterexample). I still think you can't shoot someone if you haven't got a gun, though.</p>

<p>Anyway, I enjoyed the film while feeling guilty about enjoying something that's reminding me how bad things are. I felt guilty again the next day taking the kids to see Pierce Brosnan and co playing with guns and things.</p>

<p>What's the world coming to when seven year olds are so media savvy that they go in knowing about the film's classification as containing <cite>'moderate action, violence and one sex scene'</cite> and then object when they see Pierce getting horny with Rosamund Pike after already having <cite>'sexed'</cite> (that's the word they use for it) Halle Berry?</p>

<p>They know about the classification because the Odeon emailed us this message:</p>

<p><q>The certificate for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is confirmed as 12A. However, the correct certificate addendum is in fact, "contains intense combat and fantasy horror scenes". It is <span class="caps">NOT, </span>"contains moderate action, violence and one sex scene" which was attached by mistake. This is in fact the correct certificate addendum for James Bond: Die Another Day.</q></p>
