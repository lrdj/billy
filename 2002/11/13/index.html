<h3 id="a005275">the new rosetta</h3>

<p>Just found out about the <a href="http://www.rosettaproject.org:8080/live">Rosetta Project</a> via <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,54345,00.html">this wired article</a>. The Rosetta project is an open-source collaborative project with the aim of creating a modern Rosetta stone (in this case a 3-inch nickel disk) archiving 1,400 of the 7,000 (who counted, btw? and how?) world languages.</p>

<p>Reading about it also led me to <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/"><span class="caps">OLAC</span></a> which is:</p>

<p><q>'an international partnership of institutions and individuals who are creating a worldwide virtual library of language resources by: (i) developing consensus on best current practice for the digital archiving of language resources, and (ii) developing a network of interoperating repositories and services for housing and accessing such resources.'</q></p>

<p>All this collaborative, open-source grooviness. And the joy of following one interesting link to another. It's like some kind of 'world-wide-web' or something. How long until it all gets spoiled by commercialism and we end up with pop-ups all over the place?</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<p>ps <cite>'interoperating repositories'</cite> - wish I'd coined that one</p>

<h3 id="a005274">social research projects</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.billyclark.net/images/tennisgirl.gif" alt="social research project" width="116" height="155" border="0" /></p>

<p>Went back to the <a href="http://www.instituteofvisualculture.org">Institute of Visual Culture</a> yesterday with Alan and some students.</p>

<p>I was quite impressed with my stamina, having only slept for two and a half hours the night before. It was an enjoyable day. It began with a traditional one hour wait before the third of the timetabled trains decided it could be bothered to go to Cambridge. Before going to the gallery, we strolled through Cambridge and Alan explained some stuff about the town and the university and everything. Luckily, none of the students decided to transfer.</p>

<p>The exhibition was <a href="http://www.instituteofvisualculture.org/022_present.php">'Cognition Control'</a>, a collection of work by Stephen Willats and a few others. The work on show was from the 60s and 70s and, as they say, it:</p>

<p><q>'represents a vital period in British art, when Willats and his colleagues proposed activating the audience as an integral factor in the conceptual formation of a more open-ended and inclusive art practice. Each of these projects shares a common objective to use visual arts practice as a tool for social enquiry and transformation. Their radical intervention in the cultural infrastructure of the time still resonates with, and influences, many artists working today.'</q></p>

<p>Part of the idea was to break down barriers between art and science/academia, partly by carrying out research projects that ignored the usual conventions.</p>

<p>The exhibition was a bit perplexing, partly because it's hard to leap back through the decades and imagine what it would have been like then, and especially to feel confident that you understand what they were trying to do. Was it ironic? sincere? incoherent? incompetent? Were they poking fun at scientists/academics? Or what?</p>

<p>Luckily, Stefan, the director of the institute, was there to discuss it all and I enjoyed listening to Alan and Stefan discussing it all.</p>

<p>I like the idea of using the world and the people in it as the materials for your art. And it was interesting to look at similarities and differences between this work and some of the work that goes on now. Stephen Willats hadn't really bothered to keep track of his work, catalogue it or anything. There aren't many artists around now, who would be so relaxed about what they do.</p>

<p>One thing it got us thinking about was hippiedom and the extent to which remnants of that survive. One of our students grew up in a series of communes. Are there any communes still around?</p>

<p>John says that Steve Jones played all the guitars and bass on Never Mind The Bollocks and that he only used two fingers. is this possible? I want to see a picture.</p>

<h3 id="a005272">messing about</h3>

<p>Been up half the night working a couple of times this week, and keeping <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com">dug</a> awake even though he's still suffering the results of multiple workstation destruction.</p>

<p>Now I've got time to catch up on all the important work I let slip. But first, it's time to carry out some serious research. I've started with a project to find good internet radio stations. At the moment, I'm enjoying <a href="http://www.radiomagnetic.com">radiomagnetic</a>, a groovy station operating from Glasgow which Jonathan told me about.</p>

<p>I've got to use today wisely as tomorrow I will mostly be <a href="http://www.natfhe.org.uk/says/camp0010.html">on strike</a></p>
