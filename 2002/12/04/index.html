<h3 id="a005291">Sapir-Whorf For The Day</h3>

<p>Thought I was dreaming yesterday morning when some religious geezer was giving us his <cite>'thought for the day'</cite> on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/">Today</a> programme (they won't let you talk unless you're a religious geezer, which is quite a phenomenon in itself, imho). Anyway, he was giving us a hardline version of the <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/journal/worldtour99/sapirwhorf.html">Sapir-Whorf hypothesis</a>. He went as far as to say something like that if you say <cite>'he walked through the mud'</cite> to a Spanish person he'd think about where the walker was going while if you said it to an English speaker they'd think about what it felt like to be walking through mud. This being because <cite>'English is a dynamic language'</cite>. Maybe I <span class="caps">WAS </span>dreaming...</p>

<h3 id="a005290">a modest proposal</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.zmag.org">ZNet</a> just sent me a modest proposal from Chomsky which seems not to be up on their site yet but will be soon, I guess. I'll tell you when it is but in the meantime, here's the basic idea:</p>

<p><q>One simple plan seems to have been ignored, perhaps because it would be regarded as insane, and rightly so. But it is instructive to ask why.</q></p>

<p><q>The modest proposal is for the United States to encourage Iran to invade Iraq, providing the Iranians with the necessary logistical and military support, from a safe distance (missiles, bombs, bases, etc.).</q></p>

<p><q>As a proxy, one pole of "the axis of evil" would take on another.</q></p>

<p>Chomsky is talking at the Institute of Education in London on the 10th of December, btw. Tickets are 10 quid and details are at <a href="http://www.redpepper.org.uk/xbullet.html">Red Pepper</a></p>
