<h3 id="a005296">starfucking for linguists</h3>

<p>Just finished a weekend of parties (5 in 3 days, including 1 put on by us, and 1 we didn't go to).</p>

<p>One of our guests (on Friday) and hosts (on Sunday) revealed to me that he is the grandson of <span class="caps">J.R.</span> Firth. I've been trying to find someone who'll be impressed with this ever since.</p>

<p>B-)</p>

<h3 id="a005295">more on apostrophes</h3>

<p>Jed writes:</p>

<p><q>Billy!</q></p>

<p><q>I just read your blog on apostrophes and wondered if you are interested in my apostrophe story: A million years ago when I was making TV Commercials with <span class="caps">D.A.P</span>ennebaker (he of 'Primary' and 'Woodstock' then and 'Startup.com' now) I also helped Penne in the closing post production on his film of Bob Dylans English tour. I designed the poster (now a collector's item - and No, I don't have a copy) and took his title 'Don't Look Back' and did an all caps title that became 'DONT <span class="caps">LOOK BACK'.</span> We had a lot of talk about it ( and I have some current emails from Penne discussing it again) and when it came out Safire of The New York Times went ballistic - never mind the movie, he wrote a whole column blasting the movie just for that missing apostrophe. I was quoted by Penne as saying something like 'Well, we wanted to be controversial' (which I'm sure I never said!). But today, all over the world that movie and my poster are still working together quite well without the aid of that apostrophe.</q></p>

<p><q>Cheers</q></p>

<p>ps. did you notice the apostrophe he missed out on this message too? ;-)</p>
